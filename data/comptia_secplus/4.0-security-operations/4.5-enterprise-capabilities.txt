What type of firewall rule explicitly allows specific traffic?|Implicit deny|Allow rule|Block rule|Default rule|1|Allow rules explicitly permit specific traffic based on criteria like IP address, port, or protocol. Implicit deny blocks everything not explicitly allowed, block rules deny traffic, and default rules are the fallback when no specific rule matches.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities

Which firewall principle blocks all traffic except what is explicitly allowed?|Implicit allow|Explicit deny|Implicit deny|Open by default|2|Implicit deny (default deny) blocks all traffic except what is explicitly allowed by allow rules. This is more secure than implicit allow or open defaults. Explicit deny blocks specific traffic.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities

What does an Access Control List (ACL) do?|Encrypts all traffic|Defines allowed or denied traffic based on rules|Speeds up network traffic|Backs up data|1|ACLs define rules specifying which traffic is allowed or denied based on source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and other criteria. They're used in firewalls, routers, and other network devices. They don't encrypt, speed up, or back up.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities

Which security zone typically separates internal network from external threats?|DMZ|Perimeter firewall|Guest network|Management network|1|Perimeter firewalls separate the internal network from external networks (Internet), controlling all traffic between trusted and untrusted zones. DMZ is for public-facing servers, guest networks are for visitors, and management networks are for device administration.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities

What is the purpose of DNS filtering?|Speed up DNS queries|Block access to malicious or inappropriate domains|Replace DNS servers|Encrypt DNS traffic|1|DNS filtering blocks access to malicious, phishing, or inappropriate websites by preventing DNS resolution of those domains. It provides web content filtering at the DNS layer. It doesn't primarily speed queries or replace servers, though DNS encryption is a separate security measure.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities

Which email security technique verifies that emails actually came from the claimed sender domain?|Encryption|SPF/DKIM/DMARC|Compression|Archiving|1|SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) verify email sender authenticity and help prevent spoofing. Encryption protects confidentiality, compression reduces size, and archiving stores emails.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities

What does NAC (Network Access Control) do?|Backs up network data|Controls device access based on security posture|Speeds up networks|Encrypts all traffic|1|NAC controls which devices can access the network based on security posture (patches, antivirus, configuration). Non-compliant devices may be quarantined or denied access. It doesn't primarily backup, speed up, or encrypt.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities

Which capability allows security teams to hunt for threats proactively?|Reactive monitoring only|Threat hunting|Waiting for alerts|Post-incident analysis|1|Threat hunting involves security teams proactively searching for threats and indicators of compromise before they trigger alerts, using hypothesis-driven investigations. Reactive monitoring waits for alerts, and post-incident analysis happens after compromise.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities

What is the purpose of DLP (Data Loss Prevention) at network level?|Speed up transfers|Monitor and block sensitive data from leaving the network|Encrypt all data|Compress data|1|Network DLP monitors traffic leaving the network and blocks or alerts on sensitive data transfers (credit cards, SSNs, intellectual property) to prevent data exfiltration. It doesn't primarily speed, encrypt everything, or compress.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities

Which technology identifies applications regardless of port or protocol used?|Traditional firewall|Next-generation firewall (NGFW) with application awareness|Router|Switch|1|Next-generation firewalls with application awareness can identify applications based on behavior and signatures, not just ports/protocols, since modern apps use dynamic ports and encryption. Traditional firewalls rely on ports, routers direct traffic, and switches forward traffic.|4.0 Security Operations|4.5 Enterprise Capabilities
