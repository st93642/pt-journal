Which of the following is NOT a component of digital identity?|Identifiers|Credentials|Attributes|Network packets|3|Network packets are not part of digital identity; they are data transmission units.|cissp|identity-access-management
What is the main difference between authentication and authorization?|Authentication verifies identity, authorization determines permissions|Authentication grants permissions, authorization verifies identity|Both serve the same purpose|Neither involves user verification|0|Authentication confirms who you are, authorization determines what you can do.|cissp|identity-access-management
Which authentication factor is considered "something you know"?|Password|Smart card|Fingerprint|IP address|0|Passwords are knowledge-based authentication factors.|cissp|identity-access-management
What does MFA stand for in the context of access control?|Multi-Factor Authentication|Multiple Firewall Access|Managed File Access|Main Frame Authentication|0|MFA requires multiple authentication factors for enhanced security.|cissp|identity-access-management
Which access control model assigns permissions based on user roles?|Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)|Mandatory Access Control (MAC)|Discretionary Access Control (DAC)|Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)|0|RBAC assigns permissions based on job functions and responsibilities.|cissp|identity-access-management
What is the principle of least privilege?|Users should have maximum access rights|Users should have minimum necessary access|Users should have access to all resources|Users should have no access restrictions|1|Least privilege ensures users have only the minimum access required to perform their duties.|cissp|identity-access-management
Which of the following is a behavioral biometric?|Fingerprint|Voice pattern|Iris scan|DNA|1|Voice patterns are behavioral biometrics that analyze how someone speaks.|cissp|identity-access-management
What is identity federation?|Combining multiple identities into one|Sharing identity information across domains|Creating duplicate identities|Deleting identity information|1|Federation allows users to access multiple systems with a single identity.|cissp|identity-access-management
Which protocol is commonly used for web-based identity federation?|SAML|TCP|HTTP|FTP|0|SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) enables federated identity for web applications.|cissp|identity-access-management
What is the primary purpose of session management?|To create user accounts|To control session security and lifecycle|To encrypt passwords|To monitor network traffic|1|Session management handles the creation, maintenance, and termination of user sessions.|cissp|identity-access-management
Which attack involves taking over an authenticated session?|Session hijacking|Password cracking|Man-in-the-middle|Denial of service|0|Session hijacking allows attackers to take control of active user sessions.|cissp|identity-access-management
What should happen when a user leaves an organization?|Account suspension|Account termination|Password change|Role modification|1|Account termination ensures former employees lose all access to organizational resources.|cissp|identity-access-management
Which of the following is NOT a session security mechanism?|Session encryption|Session timeout|Password complexity|Session invalidation|2|Password complexity is for authentication, not session management.|cissp|identity-access-management
What is JIT provisioning?|Just-in-Time provisioning creates accounts when first needed|Just-in-Time provisioning delays account creation|Just-in-Time provisioning deletes old accounts|Just-in-Time provisioning changes passwords|0|JIT provisioning creates accounts dynamically when users first attempt to access resources.|cissp|identity-access-management
