What is the first step in the risk management process?|Risk mitigation|Risk identification|Risk monitoring|Risk acceptance|1|Risk identification is the first step—discovering and documenting potential threats and vulnerabilities before they can be analyzed or mitigated. Mitigation comes after analysis, monitoring is ongoing, and acceptance is one response option.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.2 Risk Management

Which risk response strategy involves taking action to reduce risk likelihood or impact?|Risk avoidance|Risk mitigation|Risk acceptance|Risk transfer|1|Risk mitigation (risk reduction) involves implementing controls to reduce risk likelihood or impact to acceptable levels. Avoidance eliminates risk entirely, acceptance acknowledges risk without action, and transfer shifts risk to others (insurance).|5.0 Security Program Management|5.2 Risk Management

What risk response transfers financial risk to another party?|Risk avoidance|Risk mitigation|Risk transference|Risk acceptance|2|Risk transference shifts financial consequences to another party, typically through insurance or contracts. Avoidance eliminates risk, mitigation reduces risk, and acceptance acknowledges risk without action.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.2 Risk Management

Which risk assessment approach uses numerical values for probability and impact?|Qualitative|Quantitative|Subjective|Random|1|Quantitative risk assessment uses numerical values, calculations, and metrics (ALE, SLE, ARO) to objectively measure risk.
