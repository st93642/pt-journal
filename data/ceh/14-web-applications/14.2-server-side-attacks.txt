What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?|Server-side encryption|Forcing authenticated users to execute unwanted actions on a web application|Cross-platform file system attack|Sharing credentials across sites|1|CSRF tricks the victim's browser into executing unwanted actions on a web application where they're authenticated. Attackers exploit the trust a site has in the user's browser, causing state-changing requests without the user's knowledge.|Web Applications|CSRF
How does CSRF differ from XSS?|Both require JavaScript execution|XSS injects malicious scripts, CSRF exploits existing authentication without code execution|XSS steals cookies, CSRF performs actions|Both manipulate browser behavior|1|CSRF exploits the trust relationship between browser and site using existing authentication, while XSS injects and executes malicious scripts. CSRF doesn't require JavaScript execution.|Web Applications|CSRF
What is the most common CSRF protection mechanism?|Disabling cookies|Using anti-CSRF tokens that are unique and validated server-side|Blocking all POST requests|Requiring CAPTCHA for every action|1|Anti-CSRF tokens (synchronizer tokens) are unique per session/request and validated server-side.
