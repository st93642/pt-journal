What is the primary goal of EDR-aware tradecraft?|Bypass all security controls|Operate undetected within acceptable risk tolerance|Cause maximum disruption|Ignore security monitoring|1|EDR-aware tradecraft focuses on operating within detection thresholds while achieving objectives, not blindly bypassing all controls which may trigger alerts.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

Which technique avoids file-based detection by executing in memory?|Fileless malware|Disk-based persistence|Registry modifications|Service creation|0|Fileless malware executes entirely in memory using techniques like PowerShell reflection, avoiding traditional file-based antivirus detection.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

What is living-off-the-land (LotL) primarily designed to avoid?|EDR behavioral analysis|File system scanning|Network monitoring|Log analysis|0|LotL uses built-in legitimate tools to avoid behavioral detection patterns that EDR systems are trained to identify as malicious.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

Which PowerShell technique helps evade script block logging?|Script obfuscation|Constrained Language Mode bypass|AMSIScanBuffer bypass|All of the above|3|Multiple techniques can bypass PowerShell logging including obfuscation, CLM bypasses, and AMSI bypasses to avoid detection.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

What is process injection commonly used to achieve?|Memory evasion|Disk persistence|Network tunneling|Log manipulation|0|Process injection places malicious code into legitimate process memory, evading file-based detection and appearing as normal process behavior.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

Which C2 technique uses legitimate domains to hide traffic?|Domain fronting|Direct connection|DNS tunneling|ICMP tunneling|0|Domain fronting routes traffic through legitimate CDN domains, making it appear as normal HTTPS traffic to evade network detection.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

What is the most common EDR detection trigger for credential access?|LSASS dumping|Password spraying|Kerberoasting|Pass-the-ticket|0|LSASS dumping is heavily monitored by EDR systems as it contains credentials, making it a high-risk detection trigger.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

Which lateral movement technique is least likely to trigger EDR?|WMI execution|PSExec|Scheduled tasks|RDP hijacking|3|RDP session hijacking may be less monitored than direct remote execution methods like WMI or PSExec which create obvious process artifacts.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

What persistence method is most difficult for EDR to detect?|Registry autoruns|Scheduled task creation|WMI event subscription|Boot sector modification|2|WMI event subscriptions can be very stealthy as they don't create obvious persistence artifacts and blend with normal system management.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

Which anti-forensic technique should be avoided in EDR environments?|Log clearing|Timestomping|Evidence deletion|All of the above|0|Log clearing is highly detectable by EDR systems and should be avoided; other techniques may be more subtle depending on implementation.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

What is the primary advantage of using Cobalt Strike's Malleable C2?|Traffic encryption|Profile customization|Multi-protocol support|All of the above|1|Malleable C2 allows customization of C2 traffic patterns to blend with normal network traffic, making detection more difficult.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

Which EDR evasion technique involves modifying executable behavior?|API hooking|Code packing|String encryption|Control flow obfuscation|0|API hooking intercepts and modifies API calls to change how executables behave, potentially bypassing behavioral detection.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

What is the most effective way to test EDR detection capabilities?|Run known malware samples|Execute ATT&CK techniques|Both A and B|Neither|2|Testing should include both known malware and systematic ATT&CK technique execution to comprehensively assess detection capabilities.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

Which cloud service abuse is least likely to trigger alerts?|IAM role assumption|Resource creation|Data exfiltration|API key theft|0|IAM role assumption using legitimate credentials is a normal operation and less likely to trigger alerts than resource creation or data movement.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

What is the primary risk of using custom malware in EDR environments?|Signature detection|Behavioral analysis|Both|Neither|1|Custom malware may avoid signature detection but behavioral analysis can still identify malicious patterns, making it risky.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

Which technique helps avoid command-line logging?|PowerShell execution|Cmd.exe usage|Batch file execution|All use command-line|0|PowerShell can execute commands without spawning cmd.exe, avoiding command-line logging that captures batch and cmd execution.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

What is the most important factor in successful EDR evasion?|Speed of execution|Knowledge of target environment|Tool sophistication|All are equally important|1|Understanding the specific EDR deployment, configuration, and environment is more important than tool sophistication or execution speed.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft

Which persistence mechanism survives system reboots?|Memory-only implants|Registry autoruns|Both|Neither|1|Registry autoruns persist across reboots while memory-only implants are lost when the system restarts.|5.0 Post-exploitation and Lateral Movement|5.4 EDR Tradecraft
