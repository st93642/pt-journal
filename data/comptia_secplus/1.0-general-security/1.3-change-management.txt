What is the primary purpose of a change management process?|To speed up system updates|To minimize risk and disruption from changes|To eliminate the need for testing|To reduce documentation requirements|1|Change management processes are designed to minimize risk and disruption from changes to IT systems. They ensure changes are properly planned, tested, documented, and approved before implementation. Speed, testing elimination, and reduced documentation are not primary goals.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management

Which document outlines the steps to reverse a change if problems occur?|Change request|Impact analysis|Backout plan|Standard operating procedure|2|A backout plan (or rollback plan) documents the steps needed to reverse a change and return to the previous state if problems occur during or after implementation. Change requests initiate changes, impact analysis assesses effects, and SOPs define routine processes.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management

What is a maintenance window in change management?|Time when systems are being maintained|Pre-scheduled period when changes can be made with expected downtime|Window that must be closed before changes|Period when maintenance is prohibited|1|A maintenance window is a pre-scheduled time period when changes can be implemented, often with expected downtime. It's communicated in advance to stakeholders to minimize business impact. It's not about physical windows, maintaining systems continuously, or prohibiting maintenance.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management

What should be identified before implementing a system change to prevent unexpected failures?|All stakeholders|All dependencies|All vendors|All users|1|Identifying all dependencies (systems, services, applications that rely on or are relied upon by the system being changed) is critical to prevent unexpected failures during changes. While stakeholders, vendors, and users are important, dependencies directly affect technical success.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management

Which change management activity evaluates how a proposed change will affect business operations?|Technical review|Impact analysis|Regression testing|Version control|1|Impact analysis evaluates how a proposed change will affect business operations, systems, users, and other technical or business areas. Technical reviews assess technical aspects, regression testing checks for new bugs, and version control tracks code changes.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management

What is the purpose of a test environment in change management?|To replace production systems|To validate changes before production deployment|To train end users|To reduce costs|1|Test environments allow organizations to validate changes, identify issues, and measure implementation time before deploying to production. This reduces risk of production failures. Test environments don't replace production, aren't primarily for training, and may actually increase short-term costs.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management

Which documentation practice helps track different releases of software over time?|Change logs|Version control|Standard operating procedures|Backout plans|1|Version control systems track different versions of software, code, configurations over time, allowing teams to manage changes, collaborate, and roll back if needed. Change logs document changes made, SOPs define processes, and backout plans handle reversions.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management

What type of change typically requires full change management approval?|Emergency security patch|Standard scheduled maintenance|Major infrastructure upgrade|Routine password resets|2|Major infrastructure upgrades typically require full change management approval including impact analysis, testing, approval from change advisory board, and communication. Emergency patches may use expedited processes, standard maintenance follows predefined procedures, and routine tasks may not require formal change management.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management

What is the primary technical implication of making configuration changes during peak business hours?|Increased security risks|Potential service disruption to many users|Better change visibility|Faster implementation|1|Making changes during peak business hours risks service disruption affecting many active users, impacting business operations significantly. While security risks and visibility might be considerations, user impact is the primary technical concern. Implementation speed doesn't improve.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management

Which group typically reviews and approves significant changes in an organization?|Security Operations Center (SOC)|Change Advisory Board (CAB)|Incident Response Team|Help Desk|1|A Change Advisory Board (CAB) is a group of stakeholders from various departments who review, evaluate, and approve or reject significant changes. SOC monitors security, incident response handles security events, and help desk provides user support.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Change Management
