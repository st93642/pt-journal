Start with passive reconnaissance (no direct interaction with target):\n   - Query Certificate Transparency logs using crt.sh or similar services\n   - Check DNS databases like DNSDB, VirusTotal, and SecurityTrails\n   - Use search engines and archive.org for historical subdomains\n\n2. Perform active enumeration using tools:\n   - Run subfinder: subfinder -d target.com -o subfinder.txt\n   - Run amass: amass enum -d target.com -o amass.txt\n   - Use assetfinder: assetfinder target.com > assetfinder.txt\n\n3. Validate and deduplicate results:\n   - Combine all results: cat *.txt | sort | uniq > all_subdomains.txt\n   - Test for live subdomains: httpx -l all_subdomains.txt -o live_subdomains.txt\n   - Resolve DNS: dnsx -l all_subdomains.txt -o resolved.txt\n\n4.
