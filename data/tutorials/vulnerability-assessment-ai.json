Use AI to classify and prioritize based on CVSS scores.\n\nWHAT TO LOOK FOR:\n- High and critical severity vulnerabilities\n- Recently disclosed CVEs\n- Misconfigurations and weak defaults\n- Unpatched systems and software\n- Network-exposed services\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:\n1. Configure and run vulnerability scanning tools\n2. Review scan results and identify findings\n3. Use AI to analyze and classify vulnerabilities\n4. Prioritize remediation based on risk scores\n5. Document findings and create remediation plan\n\nVULNERABILITY SCANNING:\n- Automated scanning tools\n- Manual verification\n- False positive analysis\n\nAI PRIORITIZATION:\nAI analyzes CVSS scores and contextual factors to prioritize remediation efforts.",
