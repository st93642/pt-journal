What metric measures the targeted amount of time to restore a service after disruption?|RPO (Recovery Point Objective)|RTO (Recovery Time Objective)|MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)|MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)|1|RTO (Recovery Time Objective) defines the maximum acceptable time to restore a service after disruption. RPO defines acceptable data loss, MTTR is average repair time, and MTBF is average time between failures.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which backup type only backs up data that changed since the last full backup?|Full backup|Incremental backup|Differential backup|Snapshot|2|Differential backups capture all changes since the last full backup. Incremental backups capture changes since last backup (full or incremental), full backups capture everything, and snapshots capture point-in-time state.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What is the purpose of load balancing in resilience architecture?|Increase security|Distribute workload across multiple servers for availability|Encrypt traffic|Monitor network traffic|1|Load balancing distributes workload across multiple servers to ensure availability, improve performance, and prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed. It provides redundancy and fault tolerance. Security, encryption, and monitoring are separate functions.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which backup type captures all changes since the last backup of any type?|Full backup|Incremental backup|Differential backup|Mirror backup|1|Incremental backups capture only changes since the last backup (whether full or incremental), making them fastest but requiring all increments for full restore. Differential captures since last full, full captures everything, and mirror creates exact copy.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What metric defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss?|RTO (Recovery Time Objective)|RPO (Recovery Point Objective)|MTTR|MTBF|1|RPO (Recovery Point Objective) defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time (e.g., data can be lost for maximum of 1 hour). RTO defines recovery time, MTTR is repair time, and MTBF is time between failures.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which high availability configuration has two systems where one is actively used and the other is on standby?|Active-active|Active-passive|Round robin|Load balanced|1|Active-passive (hot/cold standby) has one actively used system and one on standby that takes over if the active fails. Active-active has both systems handling load, round robin distributes requests sequentially, and load balanced distributes by various algorithms.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What is the purpose of clustering in resilience architecture?|Reduce costs|Group multiple systems to act as one for redundancy and availability|Slow down processing|Isolate systems|1|Clustering groups multiple systems to work together as a single system, providing redundancy, high availability, and load distribution. If one node fails, others continue operation. It doesn't reduce costs, slow processing, or isolate systems.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which site type is a full replica of the primary datacenter that's ready to take over immediately?|Cold site|Warm site|Hot site|Mobile site|2|Hot sites are fully equipped, operational replicas of the primary datacenter that can take over operations immediately with minimal downtime. Cold sites have space and power but no equipment, warm sites have equipment but need data/configuration, and mobile sites are portable.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What power protection device provides temporary power during outages?|Surge protector|UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)|Circuit breaker|Power strip|1|UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) provides temporary battery power during outages, allowing graceful shutdown or continued operation until generator starts. Surge protectors protect against voltage spikes, circuit breakers prevent overload, and power strips distribute power.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which recovery site has basic facilities but requires equipment installation?|Hot site|Warm site|Cold site|Cloud site|2|Cold sites have basic facilities (space, power, cooling) but require equipment installation and configuration before use, making recovery slower but less expensive. Hot sites are ready immediately, warm sites have equipment but need data, and cloud sites use cloud infrastructure.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What is the primary purpose of geographic dispersal in disaster recovery?|Reduce network latency|Protect against region-wide disasters|Increase costs|Complicate management|1|Geographic dispersal places backup sites in different geographic regions to protect against region-wide disasters (natural disasters, power grid failures). This ensures organization survival even if entire region is affected. Latency, costs, and complexity are trade-offs, not primary purposes.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which backup strategy provides the fastest recovery but requires the most storage?|Incremental only|Differential only|Full backups only|Mixed strategy|2|Full backups only provide fastest recovery (single restore) but require the most storage space since everything is backed up each time. Incremental requires least space but slowest recovery (needs all increments), differential is middle ground, and mixed balances both.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What is RAID primarily used for?|Network security|Disk redundancy and fault tolerance|Encryption|User authentication|1|RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) provides disk redundancy and fault tolerance by distributing or mirroring data across multiple drives. If one drive fails, data remains accessible. It's not primarily for network security, encryption, or authentication.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery
