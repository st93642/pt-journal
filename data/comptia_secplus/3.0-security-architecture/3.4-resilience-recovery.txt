What metric measures the targeted amount of time to restore a service after disruption?|RPO (Recovery Point Objective)|RTO (Recovery Time Objective)|MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)|MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)|1|RTO (Recovery Time Objective) defines the maximum acceptable time to restore a service after disruption. RPO defines acceptable data loss, MTTR is average repair time, and MTBF is average time between failures.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which backup type only backs up data that changed since the last full backup?|Full backup|Incremental backup|Differential backup|Snapshot|2|Differential backups capture all changes since the last full backup. Incremental backups capture changes since last backup (full or incremental), full backups capture everything, and snapshots capture point-in-time state.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What is the purpose of load balancing in resilience architecture?|Increase security|Distribute workload across multiple servers for availability|Encrypt traffic|Monitor network traffic|1|Load balancing distributes workload across multiple servers to ensure availability, improve performance, and prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed. It provides redundancy and fault tolerance. Security, encryption, and monitoring are separate functions.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which backup type captures all changes since the last backup of any type?|Full backup|Incremental backup|Differential backup|Mirror backup|1|Incremental backups capture only changes since the last backup (whether full or incremental), making them fastest but requiring all increments for full restore. Differential captures since last full, full captures everything, and mirror creates exact copy.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What metric defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss?|RTO (Recovery Time Objective)|RPO (Recovery Point Objective)|MTTR|MTBF|1|RPO (Recovery Point Objective) defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time (e.g., data can be lost for maximum of 1 hour). RTO defines recovery time, MTTR is repair time, and MTBF is time between failures.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which high availability configuration has two systems where one is actively used and the other is on standby?|Active-active|Active-passive|Round robin|Load balanced|1|Active-passive (hot/cold standby) has one actively used system and one on standby that takes over if the active fails. Active-active has both systems handling load, round robin distributes requests sequentially, and load balanced distributes by various algorithms.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What is the purpose of clustering in resilience architecture?|Reduce costs|Group multiple systems to act as one for redundancy and availability|Slow down processing|Isolate systems|1|Clustering groups multiple systems to work together as a single system, providing redundancy, high availability, and load distribution. If one node fails, others continue operation. It doesn't reduce costs, slow processing, or isolate systems.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which site type is a full replica of the primary datacenter that's ready to take over immediately?|Cold site|Warm site|Hot site|Mobile site|2|Hot sites are fully equipped, operational replicas of the primary datacenter that can take over operations immediately with minimal downtime. Cold sites have space and power but no equipment, warm sites have equipment but need data/configuration, and mobile sites are portable.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What power protection device provides temporary power during outages?|Surge protector|UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)|Circuit breaker|Power strip|1|UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) provides temporary battery power during outages, allowing graceful shutdown or continued operation until generator starts. Surge protectors protect against voltage spikes, circuit breakers prevent overload, and power strips distribute power.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which recovery site has basic facilities but requires equipment installation?|Hot site|Warm site|Cold site|Cloud site|2|Cold sites have basic facilities (space, power, cooling) but require equipment installation and configuration before use, making recovery slower but less expensive. Hot sites are ready immediately, warm sites have equipment but need data, and cloud sites use cloud infrastructure.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What is the primary purpose of geographic dispersal in disaster recovery?|Reduce network latency|Protect against region-wide disasters|Increase costs|Complicate management|1|Geographic dispersal places backup sites in different geographic regions to protect against region-wide disasters (natural disasters, power grid failures). This ensures organization survival even if entire region is affected. Latency, costs, and complexity are trade-offs, not primary purposes.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

Which backup strategy provides the fastest recovery but requires the most storage?|Incremental only|Differential only|Full backups only|Mixed strategy|2|Full backups only provide fastest recovery (single restore) but require the most storage space since everything is backed up each time. Incremental requires least space but slowest recovery (needs all increments), differential is middle ground, and mixed balances both.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery

What is RAID primarily used for?|Network security|Disk redundancy and fault tolerance|Encryption|User authentication|1|RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) provides disk redundancy and fault tolerance by distributing or mirroring data across multiple drives. If one drive fails, data remains accessible. It's not primarily for network security, encryption, or authentication.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.4 Resilience and Recovery
What RAID level provides disk mirroring with 100% redundancy but 50% storage efficiency?|RAID 0|RAID 1|RAID 5|RAID 6|1|RAID 1 (mirroring) duplicates all data on two or more drives, providing 100% redundancy. If one drive fails, the mirror continues operating. However, storage efficiency is 50% with two drives (usable capacity equals one drive). RAID 1 provides excellent read performance (can read from multiple drives) and simple recovery (just replace failed drive), but doubles storage costs. Common in OS/boot drives and small critical databases where redundancy is more important than capacity.|3.0|3.4
Which RAID level uses distributed parity and can tolerate one drive failure?|RAID 0|RAID 1|RAID 5|RAID 10|2|RAID 5 uses block-level striping with distributed parity across three or more drives, allowing the array to tolerate one drive failure. Parity information allows reconstruction of data from a failed drive. Storage efficiency is (n-1)/n drives (e.g., 4 drives yield 3 drives of usable space). RAID 5 provides good read performance but slower writes due to parity calculations. However, rebuild times after failure can be lengthy with large modern drives, increasing risk of second drive failure during rebuild.|3.0|3.4
What backup strategy follows the 3-2-1 rule?|1 backup, 1 location|3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite|2 backups, 1 location|Unlimited copies|1|The 3-2-1 backup rule recommends: 3 total copies of data (production + 2 backups), 2 different media types (e.g., disk and tape, or local and cloud), 1 copy stored offsite (protecting against site-wide disasters). This provides redundancy against hardware failures, media corruption, and local disasters. Modern variants include 3-2-1-1-0 (adding 1 immutable/air-gapped copy and 0 errors via verification) to protect against ransomware that encrypts backups.|3.0|3.4
Which RTO scenario requires the most expensive infrastructure?|RTO: 72 hours|RTO: 24 hours|RTO: 4 hours|RTO: Near-zero (seconds-minutes)|3|Near-zero RTO requires expensive infrastructure like active-active configurations, real-time replication, automatic failover, multiple geographic locations, and possibly N+1 or 2N redundancy. This includes hot sites, synchronous database replication, clustered applications, and load balancers. Longer RTOs allow cheaper solutions like warm sites (4-24 hours), cold sites with equipment contracts (24-72 hours), or basic backup/restore processes (72+ hours). Organizations must balance cost against business impact of downtime.|3.0|3.4
What high availability configuration has multiple active systems sharing the load with automatic failover?|Active-passive|Active-active with failover|Cold standby|Manual switchover|1|Active-active with failover has multiple systems simultaneously processing requests (load sharing), each capable of handling full load if others fail. When a system fails, load balancers automatically redirect traffic to remaining systems with no manual intervention. This provides both high availability and horizontal scalability. Examples include clustered web servers behind load balancers, distributed databases with multi-master replication, and N+1 redundant configurations where N systems handle normal load and +1 provides capacity for failures.|3.0|3.4
Which Business Continuity Planning document defines step-by-step procedures for recovery?|BIA (Business Impact Analysis)|BCP (Business Continuity Plan)|DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan)|RTO (Recovery Time Objective)|2|DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan) provides detailed step-by-step procedures for recovering IT systems, applications, and data after disasters. DRP includes: recovery procedures, contact lists, system priorities, backup locations, restoration sequences, and testing schedules. BIA identifies critical processes and impacts, BCP is broader covering entire business operations (not just IT), and RTO is a metric defining recovery time requirements. DRP is a subset of BCP focusing on technical recovery.|3.0|3.4
What replication method maintains identical copies at both sites with sub-second latency?|Asynchronous replication|Synchronous replication|Scheduled batch replication|Manual replication|1|Synchronous replication writes data to primary and secondary sites simultaneously before acknowledging completion, ensuring zero data loss (RPO = 0) but introducing latency from round-trip time. Changes are not committed until confirmed at both locations. This requires high-bandwidth, low-latency network connections and sites relatively close geographically (typically <100 miles). Used for mission-critical applications where data loss is unacceptable. However, network failures can impact primary site performance, requiring careful design.|3.0|3.4
Which backup verification method ensures data can actually be restored successfully?|Backup logs|Checksum verification|Regular restoration testing|Automated alerts|2|Regular restoration testing (also called backup validation or recovery testing) actually restores backed up data to verify it's recoverable and intact, identifying corrupted backups, missing files, configuration issues, or procedural gaps before disasters occur. Schedule regular tests: restore random files monthly, full system restores quarterly, and disaster recovery exercises annually. Many organizations discover backup failures only when attempting actual disaster recovery. Checksum verification confirms files copied correctly but doesn't test full restoration procedures.|3.0|3.4
What Business Impact Analysis metric represents the financial cost per unit time of downtime?|RPO|RTO|Financial Impact|Maximum Allowable Downtime (MAD)|2|Financial Impact quantifies the cost of downtime per hour/day for each business process, including direct revenue loss, SLA penalties, overtime costs, lost productivity, and customer churn. BIA uses financial impact combined with operational impact to prioritize recovery efforts - high-impact systems get lower RTOs and more expensive HA solutions. For example, e-commerce sites may lose $100,000/hour during outages, while internal HR systems might cost $5,000/hour, justifying different recovery investments.|3.0|3.4
Which RAID level provides double parity and can tolerate two simultaneous drive failures?|RAID 1|RAID 5|RAID 6|RAID 10|2|RAID 6 uses block-level striping with double parity distributed across drives, tolerating two simultaneous drive failures. This provides higher reliability than RAID 5 during rebuilds (which take many hours with large modern drives). Storage efficiency is (n-2)/n drives (e.g., 6 drives yield 4 drives of usable space). RAID 6 write performance is slower than RAID 5 due to double parity calculations, but it's increasingly preferred as drive sizes grow and rebuild times lengthen, increasing probability of second failure during RAID 5 rebuilds.|3.0|3.4
What disaster recovery testing method fully simulates failover without impacting production?|Tabletop exercise|Full interruption test|Parallel test|Checklist review|2|Parallel testing activates the disaster recovery site and processes real transactions in parallel with production, fully testing systems, procedures, and staff readiness without actually failing over or impacting users. This validates RTO/RPO assumptions, identifies issues in recovery procedures, and builds staff confidence. However, parallel tests are expensive, complex to coordinate, and may not test final switchover procedures. Full interruption tests provide more realistic validation but risk actual outages if problems occur.|3.0|3.4
Which power protection provides long-term power during extended outages?|UPS|Surge protector|Standby generator|Dual power supplies|2|Standby generators (diesel, natural gas, or propane) provide power for extended outages (hours or days) after utility power fails and UPS battery capacity depletes. Generators typically start automatically within seconds to minutes when UPS signals power loss. Key considerations: fuel capacity (how many days?), regular testing and maintenance, automatic transfer switches, load testing, and fuel delivery contracts for extended outages. Generators require permits, noise mitigation, ventilation, and regular exercise. Critical for datacenters and facilities requiring continuous operation.|3.0|3.4
What replication topology allows multiple sites to accept writes with conflict resolution?|Master-slave replication|Multi-master replication|Backup replication|One-way replication|1|Multi-master (active-active) replication allows multiple sites to accept writes simultaneously, providing low-latency local writes and eliminating single points of failure. However, this introduces complexity for conflict resolution when different sites modify the same data concurrently. Conflict resolution strategies include: last-write-wins (based on timestamps), application-specific logic, or manual intervention. Technologies include MySQL Group Replication, PostgreSQL with BDR, and Cassandra. Requires careful design to avoid split-brain scenarios and data inconsistency.|3.0|3.4
Which disaster recovery approach uses cloud infrastructure for recovery?|Traditional hot site|Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)|Cold site|Tape backup|1|DRaaS (Disaster Recovery as a Service) uses cloud providers for recovery infrastructure, eliminating need to maintain physical recovery sites. Organizations replicate data continuously to cloud, and during disasters spin up virtual machines to resume operations. Benefits include: pay-as-you-go costs (no idle infrastructure), geographic flexibility, rapid provisioning, and elastic scaling. Providers include AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery, Azure Site Recovery, and Zerto. Challenges include ensuring adequate bandwidth for replication and recovery, and testing actual cloud recovery procedures.|3.0|3.4
What backup component stores configuration details needed to rebuild servers?|Data backups|System state/configuration backups|User files|Application binaries|1|System state or configuration backups capture OS configurations, registry settings, system files, boot files, active directory data, and application configurations needed to rebuild servers to their operational state. Backing up just user data is insufficient - you need system configurations, installed applications, dependencies, patches, and settings. Modern approaches include infrastructure as code (storing configurations in version control), golden images (pre-configured templates), and configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet) that can rebuild systems from code.|3.0|3.4
Which recovery site type has equipment installed but requires data restoration?|Hot site|Warm site|Cold site|Virtual site|1|Warm sites have hardware installed and operational, network connectivity configured, and potentially some data pre-staged, but require restoration of current data and configuration before going operational. Recovery time is typically 4-24 hours. Warm sites balance cost and recovery speed - more expensive than cold sites but cheaper than hot sites. Organizations may maintain warm sites for less-critical systems while using hot sites for mission-critical applications. Cloud services have blurred these categories with on-demand provisioning.|3.0|3.4
What failure mode occurs when network partition separates clustered systems causing both to operate independently?|Cascade failure|Split-brain|Failback|Quorum loss|1|Split-brain occurs when network connectivity loss between clustered nodes causes both to believe the other has failed, with both attempting to take over as primary. This can cause data corruption, conflicting updates, and inconsistency. Prevention mechanisms include: quorum (requiring majority of nodes to operate), fencing/STONITH (Shoot The Other Node In The Head - forcibly powering off suspected failed nodes), and witness servers (third-party arbitrators). Split-brain is particularly problematic in stretched clusters across geographic locations with unreliable WAN links.|3.0|3.4
Which RTO/RPO combination is most expensive to achieve?|RTO: 24hrs, RPO: 24hrs|RTO: 4hrs, RPO: 1hr|RTO: 1hr, RPO: 15min|RTO: Near-zero, RPO: Near-zero|3|Near-zero RTO and RPO requires the most expensive infrastructure: synchronous replication (ensuring zero data loss), active-active configurations with automatic failover, real-time monitoring, multiple geographic sites, and potentially N+1 or 2N redundancy. This might cost millions annually. Organizations must justify costs through business impact analysis - only mission-critical systems warrant such investment. Many organizations tier systems with different RTO/RPO targets based on criticality, balancing protection costs against business impact.|3.0|3.4
What backup retention approach keeps daily backups for a week, weekly for a month, and monthly for years?|Simple retention|Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS)|First-in-first-out|Random retention|1|Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS) rotation creates tiered backup retention: daily (son) backups retained for short term (7-14 days), weekly (father) backups retained medium term (4-8 weeks), and monthly (grandfather) backups retained long term (months to years). This balances recovery flexibility against storage costs and meets compliance requirements for long-term retention. Modern variants include adding yearly archival backups. GFS works with full or differential backup strategies and is commonly automated in backup software.|3.0|3.4
Which resilience testing method reviews recovery procedures through discussion without actual testing?|Full interruption test|Parallel test|Tabletop exercise|Simulation test|2|Tabletop exercises gather key personnel to discuss recovery procedures, roles, and decision-making in response to hypothetical disaster scenarios without actually executing recovery. This is the least disruptive and cheapest testing method, useful for training, identifying gaps in documentation, validating contact information, and building team familiarity. However, tabletop exercises don't validate that systems actually work or that documented procedures are accurate. Organizations should progress from tabletop → walkthrough → simulation → parallel → full tests as maturity increases.|3.0|3.4
What RAID configuration combines mirroring and striping for performance and redundancy?|RAID 5|RAID 6|RAID 10 (1+0)|RAID 0|2|RAID 10 (also called RAID 1+0) combines RAID 1 mirroring with RAID 0 striping: data is mirrored across pairs of drives, then striped across the pairs. This requires minimum 4 drives and provides 50% storage efficiency like RAID 1. RAID 10 offers excellent performance (striping) and redundancy (mirroring), tolerating multiple drive failures as long as no complete mirror pair fails. It's faster than RAID 5/6 for writes (no parity calculations) and rebuilds are faster (just copy mirror). Preferred for high-performance databases despite higher cost.|3.0|3.4
Which backup approach creates immutable copies that cannot be encrypted by ransomware?|Standard backups|Air-gapped or immutable backups|Incremental backups|Cloud backups only|1|Air-gapped or immutable backups protect against ransomware by making backups inaccessible or unmodifiable. Air-gapped backups are physically disconnected from networks (offline tape, removable drives stored offsite). Immutable backups use object lock features (AWS S3 Object Lock, Azure Immutable Blob Storage) preventing deletion or modification for specified retention periods. After high-profile ransomware attacks encrypted backups (making recovery impossible), immutability became critical. Best practice: 3-2-1-1-0 rule adds 1 immutable/air-gapped copy to traditional 3-2-1.|3.0|3.4
What network redundancy configuration has two ISPs with automatic failover?|Single ISP|Dual ISP with manual failover|Dual ISP with automatic failover|Load balanced ISPs|2|Dual ISP with automatic failover maintains connections to two different Internet service providers, with routers/SD-WAN automatically switching traffic to the backup ISP when primary fails. This protects against ISP outages, circuit failures, and routing issues. Implementation methods include: BGP with provider-independent address space (expensive), SD-WAN solutions, or basic router failover. Considerations: ensure ISPs use diverse physical paths (not just different providers over same infrastructure), test failover regularly, and monitor both links. Load balancing across both ISPs provides additional bandwidth when both are operational.|3.0|3.4
Which database recovery model provides point-in-time recovery by replaying transaction logs?|Simple recovery|Full recovery|Bulk-logged recovery|No recovery|1|Full recovery model maintains complete transaction logs allowing point-in-time recovery - databases can be restored to any specific moment by applying transaction logs. This enables recovering to just before errors occurred (accidental deletions, corruption) rather than only to last full/differential backup. However, full recovery requires more storage for logs and regular transaction log backups. Simple recovery truncates logs after checkpoints, preventing point-in-time recovery but reducing storage. Full recovery is essential for mission-critical databases where minimizing data loss is paramount.|3.0|3.4
What clustering technology allows applications to fail over to another node automatically?|Manual cluster|Failover clustering|Load-only clustering|Static clustering|1|Failover clustering (Microsoft Failover Clustering, Linux HA clustering with Pacemaker) automatically detects node failures and migrates applications, services, and IP addresses to surviving nodes with minimal downtime. Shared storage or replicated storage ensures new node accesses same data. Heartbeat mechanisms between nodes detect failures, triggering automated failover. Applications must be cluster-aware or support shared storage model. Challenges include split-brain prevention, quorum configuration, and ensuring applications can handle abrupt migration. Typical failover time: 30 seconds to several minutes depending on application complexity.|3.0|3.4
Which continuity document prioritizes business functions and identifies dependencies?|DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan)|BIA (Business Impact Analysis)|Incident Response Plan|Risk Register|1|Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is the foundation of business continuity planning, identifying critical business functions, their dependencies (systems, people, vendors, facilities), impact of disruptions (financial, operational, reputational), and establishing recovery priorities with RTO/RPO requirements. BIA informs resource allocation for resilience investments - most critical functions receive lowest RTOs and most expensive protections. BIA deliverables include criticality rankings, dependency maps, financial impact calculations, and recovery strategy recommendations. BIA should be reviewed annually or when significant business changes occur.|3.0|3.4
What storage technology enables instant recovery by booting VMs directly from backup storage?|Tape backup|Instant VM recovery|File-level restore|Bare metal recovery|1|Instant VM recovery allows booting virtual machines directly from backup storage (deduplicated disk-based backups) within minutes, enabling RTO measured in minutes rather than hours needed for full restoration. VMs run from backup while permanent restoration happens in background. Technologies include Veeam Instant VM Recovery, Rubrik Live Mount, and Commvault IntelliSnap. This is transformative for disaster recovery testing (boot DR VMs without impacting production) and actual disasters (immediate recovery while final restoration proceeds). Requires enterprise backup solutions with VM-aware backups.|3.0|3.4
Which environmental control prevents equipment damage from temperature extremes?|Fire suppression|HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning)|Video surveillance|Access control|1|HVAC systems maintain appropriate temperature (typically 64-81°F/18-27°C) and humidity (40-60%) for IT equipment. Overheating causes equipment failure, thermal throttling, and reduced lifespan. Undercooling wastes energy. Inadequate humidity causes static discharge; excessive humidity causes condensation and corrosion. Datacenter HVAC includes redundant cooling units (N+1 or 2N), hot/cold aisle containment for efficiency, and environmental monitoring with alerts. Cooling failures are leading causes of datacenter outages - equipment generates enormous heat requiring continuous cooling.|3.0|3.4
What backup approach minimizes backup window by only backing up changed data blocks?|Full backup|Changed block tracking (CBT)|Differential backup|Synthetic full|1|Changed Block Tracking (CBT) at the hypervisor level identifies specific storage blocks that changed since last backup, eliminating need to scan entire virtual machines. This dramatically reduces backup windows, network traffic, and storage requirements. VMware CBT, Hyper-V RCT (Resilient Change Tracking), and storage array snapshots enable efficient incremental backups. CBT challenges include: occasional corruption requiring resets (losing change history), ensuring consistency across backup chains, and vendor lock-in to specific hypervisors. CBT enables fast, frequent backups meeting aggressive RPOs.|3.0|3.4
Which resilience principle ensures no single component failure disrupts operations?|Redundancy|No single point of failure (SPOF)|Load balancing|Scalability|1|Eliminating single points of failure (SPOFs) ensures no single component failure can disrupt operations by implementing redundancy for critical components: dual power supplies, redundant network connections, clustered servers, RAID storage, multiple ISPs, and geographically distributed datacenters. SPOF analysis systematically evaluates architecture to identify failure risks. Example SPOFs: single network router, lone domain controller, sole database server, single backup repository, or critical employee (human SPOF). High availability requires addressing all SPOFs, which can be expensive - organizations must balance cost against availability requirements.|3.0|3.4
What disaster recovery strategy focuses on resuming only most critical functions initially?|Full recovery|Minimal operations recovery|Gradual recovery|Phased recovery approach|3|Phased recovery prioritizes resuming mission-critical functions first (as identified in BIA), then gradually restoring less-critical systems as resources allow. Phase 1 might restore core business systems (hours), Phase 2 adds important but non-critical systems (days), Phase 3 restores remaining systems (weeks). This approach manages limited recovery resources effectively, delivers business value incrementally, and allows learning from Phase 1 before expanding. Phased recovery requires clear prioritization from BIA and predetermined recovery sequences. Alternative "big bang" recovery attempts everything simultaneously, risking delays and resource conflicts.|3.0|3.4
Which backup approach creates a new full backup from previous full and incrementals without reading production data?|Regular full backup|Synthetic full backup|Differential backup|Snapshot backup|1|Synthetic full backups combine the last full backup with subsequent incremental backups to create a new full backup without accessing production systems. This reduces load on production servers and networks during backup windows while providing full backups for fast recovery. Backup server does the synthesis work using existing backup data. Benefits include: reduced backup window, less production impact, simplified restores (single synthetic full plus recent incrementals), and ability to create multiple synthetic fulls from one set of incrementals. Requires deduplicated backup storage and supported backup software.|3.0|3.4
What high availability metric represents the percentage of uptime?|RTO|RPO|Availability (SLA percentage like 99.9%)|MTBF|2|Availability percentage quantifies uptime as percentage of total time, commonly expressed as "nines": 99% (3.65 days downtime/year), 99.9% "three nines" (8.76 hours/year), 99.99% "four nines" (52.56 minutes/year), 99.999% "five nines" (5.26 minutes/year). Higher availability requires exponentially more investment. Calculation: (Total Time - Downtime)/Total Time. SLAs specify availability commitments with penalties for non-compliance. Achieving five nines requires eliminating all SPOFs, automatic failover, redundant components, comprehensive monitoring, and rapid incident response.|3.0|3.4
Which disaster scenario requires both hot site and data replication across geographic regions?|Hardware failure|Regional disaster (earthquake, hurricane, large-scale outage)|Building fire|Power outage|1|Regional disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, widespread power grid failures, regional ISP outages) affect entire geographic areas, requiring recovery sites hundreds or thousands of miles away. This demands: geographically dispersed hot sites, continuous data replication, diverse network paths, and possibly different public cloud regions. Critical infrastructure sectors (finance, healthcare, telecommunications) mandate geographic diversity. Stretched clusters across nearby locations protect against building failures but not regional disasters. Regulatory requirements often mandate minimum distances (100+ miles) between primary and recovery sites for financial institutions.|3.0|3.4
What database backup approach captures consistent point-in-time snapshot while database remains operational?|Offline backup|Online backup with snapshot technology|Cold backup|Shutdown backup|1|Online backups using snapshot technology (VSS snapshots, storage array snapshots, or database-native snapshots) capture consistent point-in-time copies while databases remain operational and accessible. Application-consistent snapshots quiesce I/O, flush buffers, and create consistent state before snapshot. This eliminates backup windows that previously required taking databases offline. Technologies include VMware snapshots with VSS integration, NetApp SnapShot, and database features like Oracle RMAN. However, snapshots alone aren't backups - they must be replicated to secondary storage for disaster recovery since snapshot and source share infrastructure.|3.0|3.4
Which continuity plan documents immediate response to contain and stabilize incidents?|BCP (Business Continuity Plan)|DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan)|Incident Response Plan (IRP)|Risk Management Plan|2|Incident Response Plans (IRP) define immediate response procedures for security incidents and operational disruptions: detection, triage, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. IRP focuses on initial hours/days - stopping ongoing damage, preserving evidence, and stabilizing operations. DRP takes over for longer-term recovery of IT systems, and BCP addresses broader business continuity including alternate facilities, communication plans, and keeping business operating. Organizations need all three plans working together, with clear handoff criteria from IRP to DRP/BCP.|3.0|3.4
What backup verification practice ensures backups completed successfully without errors?|Visual inspection|Automated backup job monitoring with alerting|Random file checks|Annual testing|1|Automated backup monitoring tracks backup job completion status, errors, warnings, duration trends, data volumes, and success/failure rates with alerts for failures or anomalies. Modern backup software provides dashboards, reports, and integrations with monitoring systems (SIEM, ITSM). Critical monitoring includes: verify all systems backed up, check for recurring errors, monitor backup window growth (may indicate problems), track tape/disk usage, and validate off-site copy creation. However, monitoring job completion doesn't guarantee data recoverability - regular restoration testing is still required to validate actual recoverability.|3.0|3.4
Which power protection design has two separate utility feeds from different substations?|Single utility feed|Dual utility feeds from same substation|Dual utility feeds from different substations (A/B power)|Generator only|2|A/B power provides two completely independent utility feeds from different substations and electrical grids, protecting against single substation failures, grid maintenance, and local distribution problems. Each feed powers separate PDUs (power distribution units), with equipment using dual power supplies connected to both (A-side and B-side). This is standard for tier 3/4 datacenters. Cost includes: dual utility service contracts, redundant distribution infrastructure, and dual-corded equipment. Facilities combine A/B power with generators and UPS for comprehensive power protection. Most outages trace to power issues - redundancy here is critical.|3.0|3.4
What database availability technology allows reads from copies while writes go to primary?|Multi-master|Read replicas (read scaling)|Mirror database|Backup database|1|Read replicas create copies of databases that handle read queries, offloading read load from primary database which handles writes. Replication from primary to replicas is typically asynchronous with slight lag (seconds). This provides horizontal read scaling, geographic read distribution for low latency, and failover targets. Technologies include MySQL read replicas, PostgreSQL streaming replication, MongoDB replica sets, and cloud database read replicas (AWS RDS, Azure SQL). Read replicas are not full HA since manual/automatic promotion is required for write failover, but they significantly improve availability and performance for read-heavy workloads.|3.0|3.4
