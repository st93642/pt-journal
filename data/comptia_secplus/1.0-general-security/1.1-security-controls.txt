What does the CIA triad stand for in information security?|Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability|Cryptography, Identity, Access|Ciphers, Integrity, Authentication|Control, Intelligence, Analysis|0|The CIA triad represents the three fundamental principles of information security: Confidentiality (protecting information from unauthorized access), Integrity (ensuring information accuracy and trustworthiness), and Availability (ensuring information is accessible when needed).|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.1 Security Controls

Which type of security control is a firewall?|Administrative|Technical|Physical|Managerial|1|A firewall is a technical (also called logical) security control. Technical controls use technology to enforce security policies. Administrative controls are policies and procedures, while physical controls protect physical assets.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.1 Security Controls

What is defense in depth?|Using only the strongest security control|Implementing multiple layers of security controls|Focusing security on the network perimeter|Encrypting all data at rest and in transit|1|Defense in depth is a security strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls throughout an IT system. If one control fails, others will still provide protection. This creates redundancy and reduces the risk of a single point of failure.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.1 Security Controls

Which authentication factor is "something you are"?|Password|Smart card|Fingerprint|Security question|2|Biometric authentication (fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans) represents "something you are". Passwords are "something you know", smart cards are "something you have", and security questions are also "something you know".|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Authentication Factors

What is non-repudiation?|Preventing unauthorized access|Ensuring data confidentiality|Proving that an action was performed|Maintaining data integrity|2|Non-repudiation provides proof that a specific action was performed by a specific entity and cannot be denied. Digital signatures commonly provide non-repudiation by cryptographically linking an action to an identity.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.3 Non-repudiation

Which of the following is an example of multi-factor authentication (MFA)?|Password and PIN|Username and password|Password and fingerprint|Two different passwords|2|Multi-factor authentication requires two or more different types of authentication factors. Password (something you know) and fingerprint (something you are) represent different factor types. Password and PIN are both "something you know", so that's single-factor authentication.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Authentication Factors

What is the primary purpose of encryption?|To detect malware|To ensure confidentiality|To verify integrity|To prevent denial of service|1|Encryption's primary purpose is to ensure confidentiality by converting plaintext into ciphertext that cannot be read without the decryption key. While some encryption methods can provide integrity verification, confidentiality is the main goal.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptography

Which security control type includes security policies and procedures?|Technical|Physical|Administrative|Logical|2|Administrative (also called managerial) controls are policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines that define how security should be implemented. Examples include security policies, training programs, and incident response procedures.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.1 Security Controls

What does integrity mean in the context of the CIA triad?|Data is encrypted|Data is accurate and unmodified|Data is available when needed|Data is backed up|1|Integrity in the CIA triad means that data is accurate, complete, and has not been modified in an unauthorized or unintended manner. It ensures trustworthiness of information and typically involves checksums, hashing, or digital signatures.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.1 Security Controls

Which of the following is an example of "something you have" authentication?|PIN code|Retina scan|Voice recognition|USB security token|3|A USB security token is a physical object that you possess, making it "something you have". PIN codes are "something you know", while retina scans and voice recognition are "something you are" (biometric factors).|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Authentication Factors
