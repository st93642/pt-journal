What principle in the CIA triad ensures that data is accessible to authorized users when needed?|Confidentiality|Integrity|Availability|Authentication|2|Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed. Confidentiality protects from unauthorized access, integrity ensures data accuracy, and authentication verifies identity.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts

Which security concept prevents someone from denying that they performed an action?|Authentication|Authorization|Non-repudiation|Accounting|2|Non-repudiation prevents denial of actions taken. It is typically achieved through digital signatures, audit logs, and cryptographic methods that provide proof of origin and integrity. Authentication verifies identity, authorization grants permissions, and accounting tracks resource usage.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts

In the AAA framework, which component determines what resources a user can access?|Authentication|Authorization|Accounting|Auditing|1|Authorization determines what resources, files, or operations an authenticated user can access. Authentication verifies identity, accounting tracks usage, and auditing reviews security events.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts

What does the "accounting" component of AAA primarily involve?|Verifying user identity|Granting access permissions|Tracking user activities and resource usage|Encrypting user data|2|Accounting in AAA tracks user activities, resource usage, login times, and data transferred. It creates audit trails for compliance and security monitoring. Authentication verifies identity, authorization grants permissions, and encryption protects data.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts

Which security methodology requires continuous verification and operates on "never trust, always verify"?|Defense in depth|Zero trust|Least privilege|Security through obscurity|1|Zero trust security operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify" and requires continuous verification of all users and devices regardless of their location. Defense in depth uses multiple layers, least privilege limits access, and security through obscurity is not a recommended practice.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts

What security analysis technique identifies differences between current security posture and desired state?|Risk assessment|Gap analysis|Threat modeling|Vulnerability scanning|1|Gap analysis identifies the differences between an organization's current security posture and its desired or required state based on standards, best practices, or compliance requirements. Risk assessment evaluates threats, threat modeling analyzes attack vectors, and vulnerability scanning finds technical weaknesses.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts

Which component of zero trust architecture makes policy decisions about access requests?|Policy engine|Policy administrator|Policy enforcement point|Trust evaluator|0|The policy engine is the component that makes decisions about whether to grant access based on policies, user attributes, device posture, and threat intelligence. The policy administrator manages policies, the enforcement point implements decisions, and trust evaluator is not a standard zero trust component.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts

What security principle states that users should only have the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions?|Need to know|Separation of duties|Least privilege|Defense in depth|2|Least privilege is the principle that users should be granted only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions. Need to know is related but focuses on information access, separation of duties divides responsibilities, and defense in depth uses multiple security layers.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts

Which plane in a zero trust architecture handles the actual enforcement of access policies?|Control plane|Data plane|Management plane|Security plane|1|The data plane (also called the policy enforcement point) handles the actual enforcement of access decisions and is where users interact with resources. The control plane makes policy decisions. Management and security planes are not standard zero trust terminology.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts

What security technology creates fake systems to detect and analyze attacker behavior?|Honeypot|Firewall|IDS|WAF|0|A honeypot is a deception technology that creates intentionally vulnerable systems to attract, detect, and analyze attacker behavior and techniques. Firewalls filter traffic, IDS detects intrusions, and WAF protects web applications.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.2 Security Concepts
