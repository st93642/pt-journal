What is the primary cause of SQL injection vulnerabilities?|Proper input validation|Unsanitized user input concatenated directly into SQL queries|Using prepared statements|Database encryption|1|SQL injection occurs when applications construct SQL queries by concatenating unsanitized user input directly into query strings instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements.|Injection Vulnerabilities|SQL Injection Fundamentals
What SQL injection technique uses the UNION operator to combine results?|Error-based injection|Union-based injection|Blind injection|Time-based injection|1|UNION-based SQL injection uses the SQL UNION operator to combine the results of the original query with results from an injected query, allowing extraction of data from other database tables.|Injection Vulnerabilities|SQL Injection Techniques
What is blind SQL injection?|Visible data extraction|SQL injection where no data is transferred via the web application|Error-based injection|Union-based injection|1|Blind SQL injection occurs when no data is actually transferred via the web application. Attackers must reconstruct database structure by sending payloads and observing application behavior.|Injection Vulnerabilities|SQL Injection Types
What is the most common command injection vulnerability pattern?|Proper argument handling|System commands executed with unsanitized user input|Input validation|Output encoding|1|Command injection occurs when applications pass unsanitized user input to system commands like ping, traceroute, or other utilities that execute external programs.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Command Injection
What characters are commonly used to chain commands in command injection?|Letters only|; | & ` $ ( ) depending on the shell|Numbers only|Punctuation only|1|Command injection uses shell metacharacters to chain commands: ; (command separator), | (pipe), & (background), ` (command substitution), $ (variable expansion), and parentheses for grouping.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Command Injection Techniques
What is LDAP injection?|Database injection|Injection where user input is improperly handled in LDAP queries|Web injection|Network injection|1|LDAP injection occurs when applications construct LDAP queries using untrusted user input without proper escaping, allowing modification of LDAP search filters.|Injection Vulnerabilities|LDAP Injection
What is the primary difference between SQL and NoSQL injection?|Database type|NoSQL injection exploits query operators and JSON structures rather than SQL syntax|Injection method|Attack vector|1|NoSQL injection exploits the query language and operators of NoSQL databases, often involving JSON objects and database-specific operators like $ne, $gt, $where.|Injection Vulnerabilities|NoSQL Injection
What is Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)?|Client-side injection|User input embedded in templates processed by template engines as template code|Server configuration|Network protocol injection|1|SSTI occurs when user input is embedded in templates and processed by template engines like Jinja2, Twig, or Freemarker, allowing injection of template directives.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Template Injection
What is the safest way to prevent SQL injection?|Input filtering|Using parameterized queries and prepared statements|Output encoding|Client-side validation|1|Parameterized queries and prepared statements are the most effective defense against SQL injection as they separate SQL code from data, preventing malicious input from being executed as SQL.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Injection Prevention
What is the OWASP recommendation for preventing command injection?|Allow all commands|Use safe APIs or whitelist allowed commands with proper input validation|Disable command execution|Use client-side filtering|1|OWASP recommends using safe APIs, whitelisting allowed commands, and implementing proper input validation to prevent command injection attacks.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Defense Strategies
What is the purpose of input validation in injection prevention?|Performance optimization|Filter malicious characters and enforce expected data formats|User experience|Database optimization|1|Input validation filters malicious characters, enforces expected data formats, and ensures that only properly formatted data reaches the application logic.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Input Validation
What is the least privilege principle in database security?|Full access for all|Granting minimum permissions required for functionality|Administrative access|Public access|1|The least privilege principle means granting users and applications only the minimum permissions they need to perform their functions, limiting the impact of successful injection attacks.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Least Privilege
What is a Web Application Firewall (WAF) used for?|Load balancing|Detect and block common web attacks including injection attempts|Database optimization|Content delivery|1|WAFs detect and block common web attacks including SQL injection, command injection, and XSS by analyzing HTTP requests and responses against known attack patterns.|Injection Vulnerabilities|WAF Protection
What is Content Security Policy (CSP) primarily designed to prevent?|SQL injection|Cross-Site Scripting and code injection attacks|Command injection|LDAP injection|1|CSP is an HTTP header that helps prevent XSS and code injection attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded and executed by web pages.|Injection Vulnerabilities|CSP Implementation
What is the most dangerous type of SQL injection?|Reflected injection|Stacked query injection allowing multiple statement execution|Union-based injection|Error-based injection|1|Stacked query injection is often the most dangerous because it allows execution of multiple SQL statements, potentially leading to complete database compromise.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Advanced SQL Injection
What NoSQL database operator is commonly exploited for authentication bypass?|SELECT|The $ne (not equal) operator to match any value|INSERT|UPDATE|1|The $ne operator in MongoDB and other NoSQL databases can be used to create conditions that match any value, effectively bypassing authentication checks.|Injection Vulnerabilities|NoSQL Operators
What is second-order SQL injection?|Immediate execution|Malicious payload stored in database then executed when retrieved in another query|Direct injection|Network-based injection|1|Second-order SQL injection occurs when malicious input is stored safely initially but later causes injection when retrieved and used in another SQL query without sanitization.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Second-Order Injection
What is out-of-band SQL injection?|Same channel attack|Using different communication channels like DNS or HTTP to exfiltrate data|In-band attack|Local attack|1|Out-of-band SQL injection uses different communication channels (DNS, HTTP requests) to exfiltrate data when in-band methods are not possible or detectable.|Injection Vulnerabilities|OOB Techniques
What is the primary defense against template injection?|Input sanitization|Avoiding user input in template rendering and using sandboxed environments|Output encoding|Parameter validation|1|The primary defense against SSTI is to avoid embedding user input directly in templates and use sandboxed template environments that limit available functions and operations.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Template Security
What is the most comprehensive approach to injection prevention?|Single control|Defense in depth using multiple security layers (validation, parameterization, WAF, monitoring)|Basic filtering|User education|1|Defense in depth combines multiple security controls including input validation, parameterized queries, WAF, CSP, least privilege, and comprehensive monitoring for maximum protection.|Injection Vulnerabilities|Defense in Depth
