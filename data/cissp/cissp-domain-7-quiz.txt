What is the primary purpose of a Security Operations Center (SOC)?|To develop new security software|To monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents|To conduct penetration testing|To manage employee access controls|1|The SOC serves as the central nervous system for an organization's cybersecurity operations, continuously monitoring systems, detecting threats, and coordinating incident response efforts.|cissp|security-operations
Which of the following is NOT a typical SOC function?|Continuous monitoring of security events|Investigation of security incidents|Coordination of incident response|Development of application code|3|SOCs focus on security monitoring and response, not software development. Application development is typically handled by separate development teams.|cissp|security-operations
What does the term "OPSEC" stand for in security operations?|Operational Security|Online Protection System|Optimized Security Encryption|Open Source Security Evaluation|0|OPSEC (Operational Security) involves protecting sensitive information about operations from potential adversaries through various security measures.|cissp|security-operations
Which incident response phase involves identifying the scope and impact of a security incident?|Preparation|Identification|Containment|Recovery|1|The Identification phase focuses on detecting and assessing security incidents to understand their nature, scope, and potential impact on the organization.|cissp|security-operations
What is the primary goal of digital forensics in security operations?|To punish attackers|To collect and analyze evidence for legal proceedings|To restore system functionality|To prevent future incidents|1|Digital forensics aims to preserve, collect, analyze, and present digital evidence in a manner that is admissible in legal proceedings.|cissp|security-operations
Which of the following is a critical component of the chain of custody in digital forensics?|Deleting evidence after analysis|Documenting all handling of evidence|Sharing evidence with all investigators|Modifying evidence for clarity|1|Chain of custody ensures evidence integrity by documenting every person who handled the evidence, when, and for what purpose.|cissp|security-operations
What type of monitoring involves analyzing network traffic patterns to detect anomalies?|Host-based monitoring|Network-based monitoring|Application monitoring|Cloud monitoring|1|Network-based monitoring analyzes traffic patterns, protocols, and data flows to identify unusual or malicious network activity.|cissp|security-operations
Which log type typically contains records of user authentication attempts and access control decisions?|System logs|Application logs|Security logs|Audit logs|2|Security logs specifically track authentication events, access control decisions, and other security-related activities.|cissp|security-operations
What is the primary purpose of security information and event management (SIEM) systems?|To store encrypted passwords|To aggregate and analyze security logs from multiple sources|To perform vulnerability scanning|To manage firewall rules|1|SIEM systems collect, normalize, and analyze security events from various sources to provide comprehensive security monitoring and threat detection.|cissp|security-operations
Which incident response phase focuses on preventing the spread of a security incident?|Preparation|Identification|Containment|Eradication|2|Containment involves isolating affected systems and preventing the incident from spreading to other parts of the network or organization.|cissp|security-operations
What does MTTD stand for in security operations metrics?|Mean Time To Detection|Maximum Threat Detection|Monthly Threat Database|Managed Threat Detection|0|MTTD measures the average time required to detect a security threat or incident from when it first occurred.|cissp|security-operations
Which of the following is a common pitfall in SOC operations?|Too many security alerts|Insufficient monitoring tools|Lack of incident response procedures|All of the above|3|SOCs often face challenges with alert fatigue, inadequate tooling, and incomplete procedures, all of which can impact effectiveness.|cissp|security-operations
What is the primary purpose of logging in security operations?|To track system performance|To provide audit trails for security events|To monitor application errors|To record user activities for marketing|1|Security logging creates detailed records of security events that can be used for incident investigation, compliance, and forensic analysis.|cissp|security-operations
Which forensic technique involves reconstructing a timeline of events from multiple data sources?|File carving|Timeline analysis|Registry analysis|Memory analysis|1|Timeline analysis reconstructs the sequence of events by correlating timestamps from various log files, system events, and digital artifacts.|cissp|security-operations
What is the main difference between volatile and non-volatile evidence in digital forensics?|Volatile evidence requires special storage conditions|Volatile evidence is lost when power is removed|Volatile evidence is more reliable|Volatile evidence cannot be hashed|1|Volatile evidence (like RAM contents) is lost when power is removed, while non-volatile evidence (like hard drive data) persists.|cissp|security-operations
Which monitoring approach focuses on individual system activity and security events?|Network monitoring|Host-based monitoring|Cloud monitoring|Application monitoring|1|Host-based monitoring collects security events and system activity directly from individual hosts or endpoints.|cissp|security-operations
What is the purpose of the "lessons learned" phase in incident response?|To assign blame for the incident|To identify improvements and prevent future incidents|To document the incident for compliance|To calculate financial losses|1|The lessons learned phase reviews the incident response process to identify improvements and prevent similar incidents in the future.|cissp|security-operations
Which of the following is NOT typically included in a security monitoring system?|Alert generation|Anomaly detection|Code compilation|Metric collection|2|Security monitoring systems focus on detection and alerting, not software development tasks like code compilation.|cissp|security-operations
What is the primary benefit of centralized logging in security operations?|Reduced storage costs|Correlated analysis of events across systems|Faster system performance|Simplified user authentication|1|Centralized logging enables correlation of events across different systems, providing better visibility into complex attack patterns.|cissp|security-operations
Which incident response phase involves removing the root cause of a security incident?|Preparation|Containment|Eradication|Recovery|2|Eradication removes the root cause of the incident, such as malware, backdoors, or vulnerable configurations.|cissp|security-operations
