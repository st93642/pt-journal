Which Linux namespace provides process ID isolation between containers?|mount namespace|pid namespace|network namespace|user namespace|1|The PID namespace isolates process ID numbers, allowing each container to have its own process tree with PID 1. This prevents containers from seeing or affecting processes in other containers or the host system.|Container Security|Isolation Fundamentals

What capability allows a container to perform privileged operations typically reserved for root?|CAP_NET_ADMIN|CAP_SYS_ADMIN|CAP_CHOWN|CAP_SETUID|1|CAP_SYS_ADMIN is the most powerful capability, allowing a container to perform most privileged operations including mounting filesystems, accessing devices, and modifying system configurations. This capability is often required for container breakout attacks.|Container Security|Privilege Escalation

Which container runtime vulnerability (CVE-2019-5736) allowed attackers to overwrite the host's runc binary?|Dirty COW|Dirty Pipe|runc escape|Docker socket mount|2|CVE-2019-5736 was a critical vulnerability in runc that allowed attackers to overwrite the host's runc binary by creating a malicious container. When the host ran new containers, the malicious runc would execute, giving attackers root access to the host.|Container Security|Runtime Vulnerabilities

What is the primary purpose of container security contexts in Kubernetes?|To encrypt container traffic|To define security settings for pods/containers|To manage resource limits|To automate container updates|1|Security contexts in Kubernetes define privilege and access control settings for pods and containers, including running as non-root, dropping capabilities, and restricting filesystem access. They are essential for hardening container deployments.|Kubernetes Security|Security Contexts

Which Kubernetes API object is used to enforce runtime security policies like prohibiting privileged containers?|NetworkPolicy|PodSecurityPolicy|ResourceQuota|LimitRange|1|PodSecurityPolicy (deprecated in 1.25, replaced by Pod Security Admission) was used to enforce runtime security policies in Kubernetes clusters. It could prevent privileged containers, require read-only root filesystems, and restrict host path volumes.|Kubernetes Security|Policy Enforcement

What does the hostPath volume type in Kubernetes allow pods to do?|Access host network interfaces|Mount host directories/files into the pod|Access host environment variables|Communicate with host services|1|hostPath volumes allow pods to mount files or directories from the host node's filesystem into the container. This can be dangerous as it may provide access to sensitive host files or allow container escape if misconfigured.|Kubernetes Security|Volume Security

Which RBAC permission in Kubernetes allows a user to create pods in any namespace?|pods/create|pods/*|pods/create in cluster-wide namespace|pods/create in specific namespace|2|The pods/* permission (wildcard) grants all pod-related operations including create. When combined with cluster-wide scope (ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding), it allows pod creation in any namespace, which can be abused for privilege escalation.|Kubernetes Security|RBAC Abuse

What is the primary risk of mounting the Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) into a container?|Network connectivity issues|Performance degradation|Container breakout and host compromise|Image layer bloat|2|Mounting the Docker socket gives a container full control over the Docker daemon, allowing it to create privileged containers, mount host volumes, and execute commands on the host system. This is a common container escape vector.|Container Security|Docker Security

Which security feature prevents containers from running as the root user by default?|AppArmor|SELinux|User namespaces|Seccomp|2|User namespaces map container UIDs to different UIDs on the host, allowing a container to run as root internally while being a non-privileged user on the host. This provides strong isolation and prevents privilege escalation even if the container is compromised.|Container Security|User Namespaces

What is the purpose of Kubernetes admission controllers?|To monitor pod resource usage|To intercept and validate API requests before persistence|To manage network traffic between pods|To handle container image scanning|1|Admission controllers intercept API requests to the Kubernetes API server before they are persisted, allowing validation, mutation, or rejection of requests based on security policies. They are crucial for enforcing security requirements like image verification and resource limits.|Kubernetes Security|Admission Control

Which tool is specifically designed for container runtime security monitoring and threat detection?|Docker Bench|Falco|Trivy|Clair|1|Falco is an open-source runtime security monitoring tool that uses system calls to detect anomalous activity in containers. It can detect container escapes, privilege escalation attempts, and other security threats in real-time using a rules engine.|Container Security|Runtime Monitoring

What does the "privileged: true" setting in a Kubernetes pod spec enable?|Higher CPU priority|Access to all host devices and capabilities|Automatic service account token|Network host mode|1|Setting privileged: true gives the pod access to all host devices and disables most security mechanisms, effectively giving it the same capabilities as processes running directly on the host. This is dangerous and should only be used when absolutely necessary.|Kubernetes Security|Pod Security

Which container image security practice involves removing unnecessary packages and tools from base images?|Image signing|Multi-stage builds|Image hardening|Vulnerability scanning|2|Image hardening involves removing unnecessary packages, tools, and services from container images to reduce the attack surface. This includes removing package managers, shells, debugging tools, and other utilities that aren't needed for production workloads.|Container Security|Image Security

What is the primary purpose of Kubernetes Network Policies?|To encrypt pod-to-pod communication|To control traffic flow between pods and namespaces|To load balance incoming traffic|To monitor network performance|1|Network Policies in Kubernetes control which pods can communicate with each other and with external endpoints. They use pod selectors and namespace selectors to define ingress and egress rules, implementing network segmentation and limiting lateral movement.|Kubernetes Security|Network Security

Which admission controller validates that container images are signed and from trusted registries?|ImagePolicyWebhook|ValidatingAdmissionWebhook|MutatingAdmissionWebhook|AlwaysPullImages|0|ImagePolicyWebhook is an admission controller that can validate container images against policies, including checking digital signatures, verifying image provenance, and ensuring images come from trusted registries before allowing pods to be created.|Kubernetes Security|Admission Control

What is the main security benefit of using read-only root filesystems in containers?|Improved performance|Reduced storage requirements|Prevention of malicious binary writing|Faster startup times|2|Read-only root filesystems prevent attackers from writing malicious binaries, modifying configuration files, or installing persistence mechanisms after compromising a container. This significantly reduces the impact of a container compromise.|Container Security|Filesystem Security

Which Kubernetes feature allows fine-grained control over container capabilities?|SecurityContext|ResourceQuotas|PodDisruptionBudgets|HorizontalPodAutoscaler|0|SecurityContext in Kubernetes allows fine-grained control over container security settings, including dropping specific Linux capabilities, setting read-only root filesystems, running as non-root users, and configuring SELinux/AppArmor profiles.|Kubernetes Security|Security Contexts

What is the primary risk of using the "latest" tag for container images in production?|Larger image size|Slower download speeds|Unpredictable image versions and potential security issues|Incompatibility with orchestration systems|2|Using the "latest" tag can lead to unpredictable deployments as the tag can be overwritten with different image versions. This makes it difficult to track which specific image is running and can introduce security vulnerabilities if a vulnerable image is pushed with the latest tag.|Container Security|Image Management

Which tool is commonly used for static analysis of container images to find vulnerabilities?|Docker Scout|Docker Compose|Docker Swarm|Docker Machine|0|Docker Scout (and similar tools like Trivy, Clair, and Anchore) performs static analysis of container images to identify known vulnerabilities in operating system packages, application dependencies, and configuration issues before deployment.|Container Security|Vulnerability Scanning

In Kubernetes, what does the "automountServiceAccountToken: false" setting prevent?|Automatic creation of service accounts|Mounting of service account tokens in pods|Automatic role assignment|Service account token rotation|1|Setting automountServiceAccountToken: false prevents Kubernetes from automatically mounting the service account token into the pod at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token. This reduces the risk of token theft and limits the pod's API access.|Kubernetes Security|Service Account Security
