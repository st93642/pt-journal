Which security control ensures that code operates with the minimum necessary permissions?|Defense in depth|Least privilege|Secure by design|Zero trust|1|The principle of least privilege ensures that code and processes operate with only the minimum permissions required to perform their functions.|cissp|software-development-security
What type of testing analyzes source code without executing the application?|Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)|Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)|Static Application Security Testing (SAST)|Runtime Application Security Testing (RAST)|2|SAST analyzes source code, bytecode, or binaries without executing the application to find security vulnerabilities early in development.|cissp|software-development-security
Which vulnerability occurs when user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries?|Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)|SQL Injection|Buffer Overflow|Command Injection|1|SQL injection occurs when untrusted user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.|cissp|software-development-security
What is the OWASP Top 10 category for insufficient logging and monitoring?|A01:2021-Broken Access Control|A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures|A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures|A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery|2|A09:2021 focuses on failures in security logging and monitoring that prevent detection and response to security incidents.|cissp|software-development-security
Which principle requires that default behavior should be secure?|Fail-safe defaults|Defense in depth|Secure by design|Least privilege|0|Fail-safe defaults ensure that when a system fails or encounters an error, it defaults to the most secure state rather than the most permissive.|cissp|software-development-security
What type of testing involves simulating real attacks against an application?|Unit testing|Integration testing|Penetration testing|Regression testing|2|Penetration testing simulates real-world attacks against applications to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and assess security posture.|cissp|software-development-security
Which of the following is a secure coding practice for handling sensitive data?|Store passwords in plain text for easy debugging|Use encryption at rest and in transit|Log sensitive data for troubleshooting|Hardcode credentials in source code|1|Sensitive data should always be encrypted both at rest (stored) and in transit (during transmission) to protect against unauthorized access.|cissp|software-development-security
What does SCA stand for in software security?|Secure Code Analysis|Software Composition Analysis|Static Code Assessment|Security Control Assessment|1|Software Composition Analysis (SCA) analyzes third-party components and dependencies for known vulnerabilities and licensing issues.|cissp|software-development-security
Which vulnerability type involves external entity processing in XML documents?|SQL Injection|Cross-Site Scripting|XML External Entities (XXE)|Broken Authentication|2|XXE vulnerabilities occur when XML parsers process external entity references, potentially allowing attackers to read local files or perform SSRF attacks.|cissp|software-development-security
What is the primary benefit of implementing security in the early phases of SDLC?|Reduced development costs|Faster time to market|Lower cost of fixing security issues|Simplified testing procedures|2|Security issues found and fixed early in development are significantly cheaper to address than those discovered later in production.|cissp|software-development-security
Which testing methodology combines SAST and DAST with runtime analysis?|Hybrid Application Security Testing|Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)|Comprehensive Application Security Testing|Integrated Application Security Testing|1|IAST combines static analysis (SAST) with dynamic testing (DAST) and runtime analysis to provide comprehensive vulnerability detection.|cissp|software-development-security
What is a common mitigation for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks?|Input validation only|Output encoding and input sanitization|Database encryption|Network segmentation|1|XSS is mitigated through both input validation/sanitization and proper output encoding to prevent malicious scripts from executing in browsers.|cissp|software-development-security
Which of the following is NOT a component of secure SDLC?|Planning phase with security requirements|Development phase with secure coding|Testing phase with security validation|Deployment phase without security checks|3|All phases of SDLC should include security considerations, including deployment which requires secure configuration and monitoring setup.|cissp|software-development-security
What type of testing involves providing random or invalid inputs to discover vulnerabilities?|Regression testing|Fuzzing|Load testing|Usability testing|1|Fuzzing provides random or malformed inputs to applications to discover crashes, memory corruption, and other vulnerabilities.|cissp|software-development-security
Which principle requires verifying all actions and never trusting by default?|Least privilege|Defense in depth|Zero trust|Secure by design|2|Zero trust assumes that no user, device, or network can be trusted by default and requires verification of all access requests.|cissp|software-development-security
What is the primary purpose of code reviews in secure development?|To check coding style and formatting|To identify security vulnerabilities and ensure best practices|To estimate development effort|To assign tasks to team members|1|Security-focused code reviews identify vulnerabilities, ensure adherence to secure coding practices, and validate security requirements implementation.|cissp|software-development-security
Which vulnerability occurs when an application deserializes untrusted data?|SQL Injection|Insecure Deserialization|Broken Access Control|Security Misconfiguration|1|Insecure deserialization occurs when applications deserialize untrusted data, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or perform other attacks.|cissp|software-development-security
