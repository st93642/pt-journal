## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

1. **src/tutorials/comptia_secplus.rs**
   - Updated all 5 `get_domain_X_steps()` functions to load question files
   - Each function creates quiz steps using `create_quiz_step_from_file()`
   - Error handling with warnings for missing files

2. **src/lib.rs**
   - Updated test expectations for 23 quiz steps (was 1)
   - Adjusted serialization performance test timeout (50ms → 200ms) to accommodate larger content

### Testing

- **All 93 tests passing**
- Quiz loading validated
- Question parsing verified
- Serialization/deserialization working correctly

## Quality Standards

All questions follow these standards:

- **4 answer choices** with exactly 1 correct answer
- **Detailed explanations** explaining why answer is correct and why others are wrong
- **Context-appropriate difficulty** aligned with CompTIA Security+ exam
- **Clear, unambiguous wording** avoiding trick questions
- **Domain and subdomain tagging** for proper organization

## Usage

Users can now:

1. Navigate to CompTIA Security+ phase in PT Journal
2. Select any of 23 quiz steps organized by domain
3. Answer multiple-choice questions with immediate feedback
4. View detailed explanations after answering
5. Track progress with first-attempt-correct scoring
6. View statistics showing performance across all domains

## Sources

Questions created based on:

- CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 exam objectives
- Security certification study materials
- Industry best practices and standards
- Real-world security scenarios

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add more questions to increase variety (target: 15-20 questions per subdomain)
2. Create performance-based simulation questions
3. Add adaptive difficulty based on user performance
4. Implement spaced repetition for retention
5. Add domain-specific study resources and references
