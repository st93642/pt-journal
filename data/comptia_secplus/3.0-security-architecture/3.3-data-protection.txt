What technique replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes?|Encryption|Masking|Tokenization|Hashing|2|Tokenization replaces sensitive data (like credit card numbers) with random tokens that can be mapped back to original data through a secure token vault. Encryption transforms data reversibly, masking hides portions, and hashing creates one-way fingerprints.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection

Which data protection method hides parts of sensitive information like credit card digits?|Encryption|Tokenization|Data masking|Data destruction|2|Data masking obscures specific portions of sensitive data (showing only last 4 digits of credit card, for example) while keeping format recognizable. Encryption makes data unreadable, tokenization replaces with tokens, and destruction permanently removes data.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection

What is the primary purpose of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions?|Speed up data transfer|Prevent unauthorized data exfiltration|Encrypt all data|Delete old data|1|DLP solutions prevent unauthorized data exfiltration by monitoring, detecting, and blocking sensitive data from leaving the organization through email, USB, cloud uploads, etc. They don't primarily speed transfer, encrypt all data, or delete old data.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection

Which concept refers to the legal requirements for data storage location?|Data classification|Data sovereignty|Data retention|Data destruction|1|Data sovereignty refers to legal requirements that data be stored in specific geographic locations and subject to laws of that jurisdiction. Classification categorizes data, retention defines how long to keep data, and destruction permanently removes data.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection

What is the purpose of data retention policies?|Delete data immediately|Define how long data must be kept|Encrypt all data|Share data publicly|1|Data retention policies define how long different types of data must be kept to meet legal, regulatory, and business requirements before secure destruction. They don't require immediate deletion, encryption, or public sharing.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection

Which technique makes data unrecoverable after deletion?|Encryption|Data wiping/sanitization|Data masking|Compression|1|Data wiping (sanitization) uses methods like overwriting, degaussing, or physical destruction to make data unrecoverable. Encryption makes data unreadable but reversible, masking hides portions, and compression reduces size.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection

What describes data stored on hard drives, databases, or backups?|Data in use|Data in transit|Data at rest|Data in motion|2|Data at rest refers to inactive data stored on physical media like hard drives, SSDs, databases, or backup tapes. Data in use is being processed, data in transit is moving across networks, and data in motion is in transit.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection

Which regulation protects personal data of EU citizens?|HIPAA|GDPR|SOX|PCI DSS|1|GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) protects personal data and privacy of EU citizens. HIPAA protects health information in the US, SOX addresses financial reporting, and PCI DSS protects payment card data.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection

What is the primary goal of encrypting data at rest?|Improve performance|Protect confidentiality if physical media is stolen|Speed up backups|Reduce storage costs|1|Encrypting data at rest protects confidentiality if physical media (laptops, drives, backups) are stolen or accessed by unauthorized parties. It doesn't improve performance, speed backups, or reduce storage costs—it may decrease performance slightly.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection

Which standard governs protection of payment card information?|HIPAA|GDPR|PCI DSS|SOX|2|PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) governs protection of credit/debit card information. HIPAA protects health data, GDPR protects EU personal data, and SOX addresses financial reporting.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.3 Data Protection
What encryption strength is recommended for protecting sensitive data at rest according to current standards?|56-bit DES|128-bit AES|256-bit AES or higher|64-bit RC4|2|256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or higher is the current recommended standard for protecting sensitive data at rest, providing strong protection against brute force attacks. AES-256 is approved for classified information up to TOP SECRET by the US government. Older algorithms like 56-bit DES and 64-bit RC4 are cryptographically broken and should not be used. 128-bit AES is acceptable for less sensitive data but 256-bit provides better future-proofing against advances in computing power and quantum threats.|3.0|3.3
Which DLP deployment model monitors data on endpoints like laptops and desktops?|Network DLP|Endpoint DLP|Cloud DLP|Storage DLP|1|Endpoint DLP agents installed on laptops, desktops, and mobile devices monitor data in use, controlling actions like copying to USB drives, printing sensitive documents, uploading to unauthorized cloud services, or taking screenshots. Endpoint DLP provides protection even when devices are offline or outside the corporate network. Network DLP monitors traffic at network boundaries, Cloud DLP protects cloud applications, and Storage DLP scans data repositories.|3.0|3.3
What data protection technique irreversibly converts data to a fixed-size hash value?|Encryption|Tokenization|Hashing|Masking|2|Hashing uses algorithms like SHA-256 or bcrypt to convert data into fixed-size hash values in a one-way transformation that cannot be reversed. Hashing is used for password storage (never store passwords in plaintext), integrity verification, and digital signatures. Unlike encryption which can be decrypted with the proper key, hashes are irreversible - you can only verify if input data matches the hash. Cryptographic hashes are collision-resistant, meaning it's computationally infeasible to find two inputs producing the same hash.|3.0|3.3
What compliance regulation requires 72-hour breach notification to supervisory authorities?|HIPAA|PCI DSS|GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)|SOX|2|GDPR Article 33 requires organizations to notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a data breach that poses a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. Delayed notification can result in significant fines up to €10 million or 2% of global annual revenue. HIPAA requires notification within 60 days for breaches affecting 500+ individuals, PCI DSS requires immediate notification to payment brands and acquirers, and SOX addresses financial reporting fraud.|3.0|3.3
Which data classification level typically allows public disclosure without harm?|Confidential|Internal Use Only|Public|Restricted|2|Public data classification indicates information that can be freely disclosed to anyone without causing harm to the organization - examples include marketing materials, public website content, press releases, and published research. Confidential data requires protection from unauthorized disclosure, Internal Use Only is for employees only, and Restricted/Classified requires the highest protection with strict access controls and would cause severe damage if disclosed.|3.0|3.3
What technique creates realistic but fake data for testing while preserving statistical properties?|Encryption|Data masking|Data synthesis (synthetic data generation)|Tokenization|2|Data synthesis generates realistic but entirely fake data sets that preserve statistical properties and relationships of real data without exposing actual sensitive information. Synthetic data is ideal for development/testing environments, machine learning training, sharing data with third parties, and demonstrations. Tools use algorithms to create data matching the schema, format, and statistical distribution of production data. This eliminates risk from using production data in non-production environments where security controls may be weaker.|3.0|3.3
Which data state is most vulnerable because encryption is often impractical during processing?|Data at rest|Data in transit|Data in use|Data in backup|2|Data in use (actively being processed in memory, CPU registers, or application buffers) is most vulnerable because it's typically unencrypted to enable processing. While data at rest can be encrypted with full disk encryption and data in transit protected with TLS, data in use must be decrypted for computations. Memory scraping malware, cold boot attacks, and application vulnerabilities can expose data in use. Emerging technologies like Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions), AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization), and homomorphic encryption aim to protect data in use.|3.0|3.3
What regulation mandates protecting cardholder data and prohibits storing sensitive authentication data after authorization?|HIPAA|GDPR|PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)|FERPA|2|PCI DSS Requirement 3 mandates protecting stored cardholder data and explicitly prohibits storing sensitive authentication data (CAV2/CVC2/CVV2, PIN blocks, magnetic stripe data) after transaction authorization completes. Organizations must encrypt cardholder data at rest, implement key management, and minimize storage. PCI DSS applies to all entities storing, processing, or transmitting payment card data. Non-compliance can result in fines up to $100,000 per month, increased transaction fees, and loss of ability to process card payments.|3.0|3.3
Which encryption approach uses the same key for both encryption and decryption?|Asymmetric encryption|Public key encryption|Symmetric encryption|Hash functions|2|Symmetric encryption uses a single shared secret key for both encryption and decryption, providing fast performance ideal for encrypting large amounts of data. Algorithms include AES (most common), ChaCha20, and 3DES (deprecated). The challenge is secure key distribution - how do parties exchange the key without interception? Symmetric encryption is typically used for data at rest (full disk encryption, database encryption) and combined with asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange in protocols like TLS.|3.0|3.3
What DLP technique uses predefined patterns like regular expressions to identify sensitive data?|Manual review|Content-aware inspection (pattern matching)|Contextual analysis|Statistical methods|1|Content-aware inspection uses predefined patterns, regular expressions, keywords, and data identifiers to detect sensitive data like credit card numbers (Luhn algorithm validation), SSNs (XXX-XX-XXXX format), HIPAA patient identifiers, or classified document markings. Advanced DLP combines pattern matching with contextual analysis (file location, user role, destination), fingerprinting (hashing documents), and machine learning to reduce false positives. Pattern matching is fast and effective for structured data but may miss sensitive information in non-standard formats.|3.0|3.3
Which data anonymization technique removes identifying information to prevent re-identification?|Encryption|Pseudonymization|De-identification (anonymization)|Masking|2|De-identification (true anonymization) removes or transforms personally identifiable information (PII) so individuals cannot be re-identified, even with additional data. Techniques include removing direct identifiers (names, SSNs), generalizing quasi-identifiers (age ranges instead of exact dates, ZIP code regions), and adding noise. True anonymization makes GDPR and CCPA regulations no longer applicable since data can't be tied to individuals. However, research has shown many "anonymized" datasets can be re-identified through linkage attacks combining multiple data sources.|3.0|3.3
What is the primary difference between pseudonymization and anonymization?|No difference|Pseudonymization is reversible with additional data, anonymization is irreversible|Pseudonymization is faster|Anonymization uses encryption|1|Pseudonymization replaces identifiers with pseudonyms (tokens or codes) that can be mapped back to original identities using a separate lookup table kept secure. This allows data analysis while reducing privacy risk, and re-identification is possible for authorized personnel with the mapping key. Anonymization makes re-identification impossible even with additional information. GDPR encourages pseudonymization as a security measure but still treats pseudonymized data as personal data requiring protection, while properly anonymized data falls outside GDPR scope.|3.0|3.3
Which US healthcare regulation requires protecting electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)?|PCI DSS|GDPR|HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)|SOX|2|HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities and business associates to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards protecting ePHI confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Requirements include access controls, audit logs, encryption for data in transit and at rest (addressable), workforce training, and business associate agreements. HIPAA violations can result in fines from $100 to $50,000 per violation with annual maximum of $1.5 million per violation category. Notable breaches include Anthem (80M records, $16M fine) and Premera Blue Cross (11M records, $6.85M fine).|3.0|3.3
What tokenization architecture stores token-to-value mappings in a secure database?|Stateless tokenization|Vaultless tokenization|Vault-based tokenization|Format-preserving tokenization|2|Vault-based tokenization stores the mapping between tokens and original values in a highly secured token vault database, requiring database lookup for detokenization. The vault becomes a critical security control point requiring strong access controls, encryption, HSM protection, and high availability. Benefits include flexible token formats and ability to tokenize any data type. Drawbacks include vault becoming a single point of failure, scalability challenges, and performance overhead for lookups. Stateless/vaultless tokenization uses cryptographic methods without database lookups.|3.0|3.3
Which data disposal method overwrites storage media multiple times with random patterns?|Encryption|Physical destruction|Data wiping (secure erasure)|Deletion|2|Data wiping (secure erasure) overwrites storage media multiple times with random data, specific patterns, or cryptographic erasure keys, making original data unrecoverable. Standards include DoD 5220.22-M (3 passes for magnetic media), NIST SP 800-88 (vendor-specific commands for SSDs), and Gutmann method (35 passes, now considered overkill). For SSDs, cryptographic erasure (destroying encryption keys) or manufacturer secure erase commands are more effective than overwriting. Physical destruction (shredding, degaussing, incineration) is required for highest security classifications or end-of-life media.|3.0|3.3
What Rights Management technology controls how documents can be used after delivery to recipients?|File encryption|Digital Rights Management (DRM) or Information Rights Management (IRM)|Access Control Lists|Network segmentation|1|IRM (Information Rights Management), also called Enterprise Rights Management or DRM for documents, embeds usage policies into documents themselves, controlling actions like viewing, editing, printing, copying, forwarding, and setting expiration dates even after files leave organizational control. Technologies include Microsoft Azure Information Protection, Adobe Policy Server, and Fasoo. IRM requires persistent protection through encryption tied to identity verification - attempting to access a protected document requires authentication to a rights server that enforces current policies and can remotely revoke access.|3.0|3.3
Which data retention consideration balances legal hold requirements against minimization principles?|Store everything forever|Delete all data immediately|Retention schedules with legal hold exceptions|Random deletion|2|Data retention schedules define how long each data category must be kept to meet legal, regulatory, and business requirements before deletion. However, legal holds (litigation holds) must override retention schedules to preserve evidence relevant to ongoing or anticipated litigation, investigations, or audits. This creates tension with privacy regulations like GDPR requiring data minimization and storage limitation. Best practice: document retention policies, implement legal hold processes, use metadata tagging, and audit compliance regularly.|3.0|3.3
What encryption method allows computations on encrypted data without decryption?|Symmetric encryption|Asymmetric encryption|Homomorphic encryption|Hashing|2|Homomorphic encryption allows mathematical operations on encrypted data, producing encrypted results that when decrypted match operations performed on plaintext. This enables cloud computing on sensitive data without exposing it to the cloud provider - for example, encrypted database queries, privacy-preserving machine learning, or secure multi-party computation. Types include partially homomorphic (one operation type), somewhat homomorphic (limited operations), and fully homomorphic (arbitrary computations). However, homomorphic encryption is computationally expensive, currently 100-1000x slower than plaintext operations, limiting production adoption.|3.0|3.3
Which data sovereignty challenge arises when data is replicated across cloud regions?|Performance optimization|Multi-jurisdictional compliance requirements|Cost reduction|Simplified management|1|Data sovereignty requires data to be subject to laws of the country where it physically resides. Cloud providers replicate data across regions for redundancy, but this creates compliance challenges when data crosses borders - EU GDPR restricts transfers outside EU/EEA without adequacy decisions or safeguards, Russian data localization requires Russian citizen data stored in Russia, Chinese Cybersecurity Law requires critical data stored in China. Organizations must: map data flows, configure cloud regions carefully, use encryption, implement data residency controls, and negotiate Data Processing Agreements with cloud providers.|3.0|3.3
What masking technique consistently replaces the same input with the same masked output?|Random masking|Static data masking|Deterministic masking|Dynamic masking|2|Deterministic masking applies the same transformation to identical input values, preserving referential integrity across databases - for example, all instances of customer ID "12345" become "67890" consistently. This maintains relationships and allows testing of applications requiring linked data across tables. Static masking creates persistent masked copies for non-production environments. Dynamic masking applies real-time transformations when data is queried, showing original data to authorized users and masked data to others without creating separate copies.|3.0|3.3
Which regulation protects student education records in the United States?|HIPAA|GDPR|FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)|PCI DSS|2|FERPA protects the privacy of student education records at schools receiving federal funding, giving parents (and students over 18) rights to inspect records, request corrections, and control disclosure. Schools must obtain written consent before releasing records except in specific circumstances like school officials with legitimate educational interest, other schools to which students transfer, or in response to subpoenas. Violations can result in loss of federal funding. FERPA applies to grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, and personal information but not directory information if properly designated.|3.0|3.3
What DLP deployment monitors data transmitted across network boundaries?|Endpoint DLP|Network DLP|Cloud DLP|Discovery DLP|1|Network DLP deploys at network perimeters (gateways, proxies, email servers) monitoring data in transit leaving or entering the organization through email, web, FTP, IM, and other protocols. Network DLP can block transmissions, quarantine messages for review, encrypt attachments, or alert security teams. However, Network DLP cannot inspect SSL/TLS encrypted traffic without decryption, cannot protect data on mobile endpoints outside the network, and has limited visibility into cloud applications using browser-based access.|3.0|3.3
Which cryptographic property ensures that even small changes to input produce completely different hash outputs?|Collision resistance|Avalanche effect|Pre-image resistance|Irreversibility|1|The avalanche effect (also called the butterfly effect in cryptography) is a property where changing even a single bit of input produces a drastically different hash output - ideally, about 50% of output bits flip. This prevents attackers from deducing input from output patterns and ensures hashes appear random. The avalanche effect is critical for security - without it, similar inputs would produce similar hashes, enabling pattern analysis attacks. Good cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 exhibit strong avalanche effect.|3.0|3.3
What technique protects credit card primary account numbers while preserving first six and last four digits?|Full encryption|Format-preserving tokenization|Complete masking|Hashing|1|Format-preserving tokenization (FPE) generates tokens maintaining the same format, length, and character set as original data - for example, replacing a 16-digit credit card number with a different 16-digit token preserving first six digits (BIN/IIN for routing) and last four (for customer reference). This allows tokens to work with existing systems expecting specific data formats without application changes. NIST has standardized format-preserving encryption algorithms FF1 and FF3-1. Common in payment systems and legacy applications that cannot handle arbitrary token formats.|3.0|3.3
Which data destruction method disrupts magnetic fields on hard drives?|Overwriting|Degaussing|Encryption|File deletion|1|Degaussing uses powerful magnets to disrupt magnetic fields on hard disk drives and magnetic tapes, rendering data unrecoverable. Industrial degaussers generate intense magnetic fields (thousands of gauss) that randomize magnetic particles. Degaussing is effective for HDDs but does NOT work on SSDs, USB drives, or other flash memory (which don't use magnetic storage). Degaussed drives are typically unusable afterward since servo tracks and firmware are destroyed. Degaussing is required by some regulations for classified media and is faster than overwriting large drives.|3.0|3.3
What DLP detection method analyzes file context like location, user role, and destination?|Pattern matching|Fingerprinting|Contextual analysis|Keyword search|2|Contextual analysis examines metadata and environmental factors beyond content - evaluating file location (is it in a protected folder?), user role (does this person normally access this data?), destination (internal vs external, geographic location), time of day, volume of data, application used, and data classification labels. Contextual analysis reduces false positives by understanding intent - emailing a document to your personal Gmail is suspicious, but sending the same document to a business partner's verified email is legitimate. Context-aware DLP provides smarter, more accurate protection than pattern matching alone.|3.0|3.3
Which data classification marking requirement specifies visual labels on documents and screens?|Technical controls only|Metadata tagging only|Physical and visual markings (headers, footers, watermarks)|Encryption labels only|2|Classification markings include visual indicators like headers/footers on documents (TOP SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL), watermarks (visible or digital), cover sheets, labels on storage media, screen banners on classified systems, and email subject line tags. These visual markings immediately communicate sensitivity level to users and prevent inadvertent disclosure. Markings must be standardized, persistent, and accompanied by handling instructions. NIST SP 800-53 AC-16 addresses security and privacy attributes including markings. Automated classification tools can apply markings based on content analysis.|3.0|3.3
What GDPR right allows individuals to request deletion of their personal data?|Right to access|Right to rectification|Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)|Right to portability|2|GDPR Article 17 grants the right to erasure (right to be forgotten), requiring organizations to delete personal data upon request when: consent is withdrawn, data is no longer necessary for original purpose, individual objects to processing, data was unlawfully processed, or deletion is required for legal compliance. Exceptions include freedom of expression, legal obligations, public interest, scientific research, and defense of legal claims. Organizations must respond within 30 days and inform third parties where data was disclosed. Google Spain v. AEPD (2014) established this right in search results.|3.0|3.3
Which encryption key length is considered secure against brute force attacks with current technology?|40-bit|56-bit|128-bit or higher|64-bit|2|128-bit keys or higher are considered secure against brute force attacks with current technology - a 128-bit key has 2^128 (340 undecillion) possible combinations, requiring centuries to brute force with all computing power on Earth. 256-bit keys provide even higher security margins against future quantum computers. Historical weak keys: 40-bit export-grade (hours to crack), 56-bit DES (cracked in 1999), 64-bit (vulnerable). RSA requires longer key lengths - 2048-bit minimum, 3072-bit recommended, due to different mathematical complexity than symmetric algorithms.|3.0|3.3
What data protection strategy maintains separate isolated copies of sensitive data to limit breach impact?|Data consolidation|Data segregation and compartmentalization|Data duplication|Data federation|1|Data segregation and compartmentalization divides sensitive data into isolated segments with separate access controls, limiting blast radius if one area is compromised. Implementations include: database segmentation by customer/region, network air gaps for sensitive systems, separate encryption keys per data classification, micro-segmentation with zero trust, and need-to-know access controls. This follows defense in depth principles - Target's 2013 breach compromised POS systems but shouldn't have reached corporate servers storing customer data if proper segmentation existed. Compartmentalization is fundamental to classified government systems.|3.0|3.3
Which data loss scenario requires different protection than exfiltration?|Intentional deletion|Accidental disclosure|Insider theft|External hacker theft|0|Data loss includes accidental deletion, corruption, natural disasters, hardware failures, and ransomware - requiring backup and recovery solutions, version control, and business continuity planning. Data breach (exfiltration) is unauthorized access and theft requiring access controls, encryption, DLP, and monitoring. Both are important but require different security controls. Organizations often focus on breach prevention but neglect backup strategies - the 3-2-1 rule recommends 3 copies, 2 different media types, 1 offsite, with immutable/air-gapped backups protecting against ransomware.|3.0|3.3
What technique allows databases to show different data to users based on their roles without creating multiple copies?|Static masking|Data replication|Dynamic data masking|Database partitioning|2|Dynamic data masking (DDM) applies real-time masking rules when data is queried, showing original data to privileged users and masked data to others without storing multiple copies. For example, customer service representatives see masked SSNs (XXX-XX-1234) while compliance auditors see full values. DDM rules define masking functions per column/role: random masking, partial masking, nulling, or custom functions. Benefits include immediate policy changes without data transformation and reduced storage. Limitations: performance overhead, cannot prevent privileged user access, and queries must go through the DDM engine.|3.0|3.3
Which backup encryption consideration prevents backups from becoming attack vectors?|Never encrypt backups|Only encrypt transmission, not storage|Encrypt backups at rest and in transit with separate keys|Use same key as production|2|Backup encryption requires protecting both at rest (encrypted backup files) and in transit (encrypted backup traffic), ideally using separate encryption keys from production systems. If production encryption keys are compromised, backups remain protected. Additional considerations: store backup encryption keys separately from backup data (offline or in HSM), implement key escrow for disaster recovery, test restoration from encrypted backups regularly, and protect key management infrastructure. Veeam ransomware attacks exploited unencrypted backup repositories - encrypted immutable backups would have prevented data loss.|3.0|3.3
What California privacy law grants consumers rights similar to GDPR?|HIPAA|FERPA|CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)|PCI DSS|2|CCPA (effective January 2020) grants California consumers rights to: know what personal data is collected, know if data is sold/shared and to whom, opt-out of data sales, request deletion, and non-discrimination for exercising rights. CCPA applies to for-profit businesses meeting thresholds: $25M+ revenue, data on 50,000+ consumers, or 50%+ revenue from data sales. Fines up to $7,500 per intentional violation. CPRA (2023 amendment) added sensitive data restrictions and created California Privacy Protection Agency. Many organizations apply CCPA rights nationwide rather than geofencing California residents.|3.0|3.3
Which data minimization principle states organizations should only collect data necessary for stated purposes?|Collect everything|Purpose limitation|Data hoarding|Unlimited retention|1|Purpose limitation (GDPR Article 5) requires collecting personal data only for specified, explicit, legitimate purposes and not processing for incompatible purposes without additional consent. This prevents "function creep" where data collected for one purpose is repurposed. Organizations must: define purposes before collection, document purposes in privacy policies, conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments for new processing, and obtain new consent for materially different uses. Purpose limitation works with data minimization (don't collect unnecessary data), storage limitation (don't keep indefinitely), and transparency (clearly communicate purposes to users).|3.0|3.3
What tokenization advantage over encryption eliminates key management complexity for some use cases?|Tokens are faster|Vaultless tokenization has no keys|Tokens work without decryption for display purposes|Tokens compress data|2|Format-preserving tokens can be used for non-sensitive operations (display, logging, analytics) without detokenization, unlike encrypted data requiring decryption. For example, showing last 4 digits of tokenized card numbers doesn't require vault access. This reduces key management burden for display purposes while vault-based detokenization still requires key management for reconstruction. However, stateless/vaultless tokenization using cryptographic methods still requires key protection. Tokenization shifts security focus from protecting encrypted data everywhere to protecting the vault - a more manageable problem.|3.0|3.3
Which data residency requirement mandates Russian citizen data be stored on servers located in Russia?|GDPR|CCPA|Russian Data Localization Law|HIPAA|2|Russian Federal Law No. 242-FZ (2015) requires personal data of Russian citizens to be stored on servers physically located in Russia, with primary processing occurring in Russia before international transfers. This data localization law aims to give government access to data and reduce reliance on foreign providers. Non-compliance can result in website blocking (LinkedIn blocked in 2016 for non-compliance). Similar data localization laws exist in China, Vietnam, and are proposed in India. These laws conflict with cloud architectures using global distribution and complicate multinational operations.|3.0|3.3
What quantum computing threat to current encryption drives post-quantum cryptography development?|Quantum computers are slower|Shor's algorithm can break RSA and ECC in polynomial time|Quantum computers require too much power|Quantum randomness|1|Shor's algorithm (1994) demonstrated that sufficiently powerful quantum computers could break RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography in polynomial time by efficiently factoring large numbers and solving discrete logarithm problems. Current RSA-2048 would require millions of qubits, but quantum computers are advancing. NIST is standardizing post-quantum cryptography algorithms resistant to quantum attacks: lattice-based (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium), hash-based signatures, and code-based encryption. Organizations should inventory cryptographic systems, plan migration timelines, and implement crypto-agility for algorithm updates. Symmetric encryption like AES-256 is quantum-resistant with larger key sizes.|3.0|3.3
Which data breach response action prevents further unauthorized access?|Document the breach|Containment and remediation|Legal notification|Public disclosure|1|Containment immediately stops further unauthorized access through actions like: isolating affected systems, disabling compromised accounts, revoking credentials, patching vulnerabilities, blocking malicious IPs, and shutting down attack vectors. Containment must balance stopping the breach against preserving forensic evidence. Remediation follows: removing malware, restoring from clean backups, rebuilding compromised systems, implementing additional security controls, and validating attacker has been removed. Containment is the highest priority after initial detection - delaying containment to investigate allows attackers to steal more data or establish persistence.|3.0|3.3
What DLP capability discovers and classifies sensitive data across repositories?|Endpoint monitoring|Network monitoring|Data discovery and classification|Incident response|2|DLP discovery crawls file shares, databases, SharePoint, cloud storage, and endpoints to identify sensitive data locations through content inspection, pattern matching, and metadata analysis. This creates an inventory showing where sensitive data resides, who accesses it, and whether it's properly protected. Discovery enables: risk assessment, identifying shadow IT, proving compliance, targeting remediation, and baselining for monitoring. Discovery findings inform protection policies - you can't protect what you don't know exists. Technologies include Microsoft Information Protection scanner, Varonis DatAdvantage, and Symantec Data Insight.|3.0|3.3
