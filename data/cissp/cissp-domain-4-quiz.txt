What is the purpose of a DMZ?|To host public web servers|To provide secure remote access|To store sensitive data|To run administrative tasks|0|A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a network segment that contains public-facing services isolated from the internal network.|CISSP|Communication and Network Security

Which attack involves sending unsolicited ARP replies?|ARP poisoning|DNS spoofing|IP spoofing|MAC flooding|0|ARP poisoning involves sending fake ARP replies to associate attacker's MAC address with legitimate IP addresses.|CISSP|Communication and Network Security

What does a next-generation firewall (NGFW) provide?|Basic packet filtering|Advanced threat protection and application awareness|Simple port blocking|Basic routing|1|NGFWs provide deep packet inspection, application awareness, and advanced threat protection beyond traditional firewalls.|CISSP|Communication and Network Security

Which protocol is used for secure web communications?|HTTP|FTP|SMTP|HTTPS|3|HTTPS uses TLS/SSL to provide secure web communications over HTTP.|CISSP|Communication and Network Security

What is network address translation (NAT) primarily used for?|Network security|IP address conservation|Data encryption|Traffic monitoring|1|NAT allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, conserving IPv4 addresses.|CISSP|Communication and Network Security

Which IDS type uses known attack signatures?|Signature-based IDS|Anomaly-based IDS|Heuristic-based IDS|Behavior-based IDS|0|Signature-based IDS compares network traffic against databases of known attack signatures.|CISSP|Communication and Network Security

What does a VPN concentrator do?|Manages VPN connections|Encrypts individual files|Monitors network traffic|Provides DNS services|0|A VPN concentrator is a network device that manages and terminates multiple VPN connections.|CISSP|Communication and Network Security
