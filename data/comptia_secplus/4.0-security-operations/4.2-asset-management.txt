What is the first step in proper asset management?|Disposal|Acquisition and inventory|Monitoring|Decommissioning|1|Acquisition and inventory is the first stepâ€”identifying, documenting, and tracking all organizational assets including hardware, software, and data. Monitoring comes later, and disposal/decommissioning are final steps in the asset lifecycle.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management

Which asset management practice tracks asset location, ownership, and status?|Asset tagging and tracking|Asset encryption|Asset destruction|Asset purchasing|0|Asset tagging and tracking uses identifiers (RFID, barcodes, serial numbers) to track asset location, ownership, custodian, and status throughout lifecycle. Encryption protects data, destruction is disposal, and purchasing is acquisition.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management

What should be done before disposing of storage media containing sensitive data?|Sell it immediately|Securely wipe or physically destroy it|Donate it|Store it indefinitely|1|Storage media must be securely wiped (data sanitization) or physically destroyed before disposal to prevent data recovery. Immediate sale or donation risks data exposure, and indefinite storage isn't disposal.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management

Which asset lifecycle phase involves removing assets from service?|Procurement|Deployment|Maintenance|Decommissioning|3|Decommissioning involves securely removing assets from service, sanitizing data, documenting disposal, and updating inventory. Procurement acquires assets, deployment puts them in service, and maintenance keeps them operational.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management

What information should an asset inventory typically include?|Only purchase price|Hostname, location, owner, configuration, and security status|Just the asset name|Only the manufacturer|1|Comprehensive asset inventories include hostname, IP address, location, owner/custodian, configuration, software versions, security status, and more. Price alone, just name, or only manufacturer provide insufficient information for proper management.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management

Which practice ensures assigned assets are accounted for?|Random selection|Assignment and accountability tracking|Ignoring asset locations|No documentation|1|Assignment and accountability tracking ensures assets are assigned to specific individuals or departments who are responsible for them. This creates accountability and helps prevent loss. Random selection, ignoring locations, and no documentation fail to establish accountability.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management

What is enumeration in asset management?|Deleting assets|Discovering and cataloging all assets on the network|Encrypting assets|Purchasing new assets|1|Enumeration is the process of discovering and cataloging all assets connected to the network, including unauthorized or shadow IT devices. This provides complete visibility. Deletion, encryption, and purchasing are different asset management activities.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management

Which process verifies that assets are properly configured according to standards?|Random checks|Configuration audits|Asset purchasing|Physical destruction|1|Configuration audits verify that assets are properly configured according to security baselines and organizational standards. Random checks are less systematic, purchasing acquires assets, and destruction disposes of them.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management

What should organizations maintain for software assets?|Only free software|Software licenses and compliance tracking|Pirated software|No records|1|Organizations must maintain software licenses and track compliance to avoid legal issues, security risks from unlicensed software, and audit violations. Only free software limits functionality, pirated software is illegal, and no records creates compliance risks.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management

Which data destruction method uses magnetic fields to erase data from magnetic media?|Degaussing|Shredding|Incineration|Recycling|0|Degaussing uses powerful magnetic fields to erase data from magnetic storage media like hard drives and tapes by disrupting magnetic patterns. Shredding physically destroys media, incineration burns it, and recycling may not destroy data.|4.0 Security Operations|4.2 Asset Management
What asset management database tracks hardware, software, configurations, and relationships between IT assets?|Spreadsheet only|Configuration Management Database (CMDB)|Personal notebook|Email list|1|Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is centralized repository tracking all IT assets (Configuration Items - CIs) including hardware, software, network devices, documentation, and relationships/dependencies between them. Benefits: (1) Change impact analysis (understand what breaks if server goes down), (2) Incident management (quickly identify affected systems), (3) Compliance reporting (inventory for audits), (4) License management. CMDB vs asset inventory: CMDB includes relationships and configurations, asset inventory just tracks what exists. Tools: ServiceNow CMDB, BMC Atrium, Micro Focus UCMDB. Challenges: keeping data current requires integration with discovery tools, manual updates create drift. ITIL framework emphasizes CMDB for change and configuration management. Essential for large enterprises with complex interdependencies.|4.0|4.2
Which asset lifecycle phase involves verifying vendor security, evaluating risks, and ensuring compliance before purchase?|Random buying|Acquisition and procurement with security review|Immediate purchase|Skip evaluation|1|Acquisition and procurement with security review evaluates vendors, products, and security implications before purchase. Steps: (1) Vendor due diligence (financial stability, security posture, data handling, certifications SOC 2/ISO 27001), (2) Product security assessment (vulnerabilities, patch history, EOL timeline, secure by default), (3) Contract terms (SLAs, liability, breach notification, data ownership, right to audit), (4) Compliance validation (HIPAA/PCI DSS requirements), (5) TCO analysis including security costs. Security considerations: supply chain risks, vendor access requirements, data residency, encryption capabilities, integration with existing security tools. RFP/RFQ include security requirements. Procurement failures: SolarWinds 2020 supply chain attack, inadequate vendor vetting. Contrast impulse purchases creating shadow IT without security review. Procurement process prevents introducing insecure or non-compliant assets.|4.0|4.2
What practice assigns unique identifiers to track assets throughout their lifecycle?|No identification|Asset tagging (barcodes, RFID, serial numbers)|Verbal communication only|Memory-based tracking|1|Asset tagging assigns unique identifiers enabling tracking throughout lifecycle from acquisition to disposal. Methods: (1) Barcodes (2D QR codes or 1D linear barcodes scanned with mobile devices, low cost, requires line of sight), (2) RFID tags (radio frequency identification, passive tags powered by reader or active tags with battery, read without line of sight, bulk scanning, higher cost), (3) Serial numbers (manufacturer assigned, recorded in asset database), (4) GPS tracking (real-time location for vehicles/high-value assets), (5) Asset management software integration. Benefits: prevent loss/theft (hospital equipment, laptops), audit compliance, maintenance scheduling, automated check-in/out, warranty tracking. Implementation: tag at receiving, scan during inventory counts, update location changes, link to CMDB. High-value assets may use tamper-evident tags. Mobile asset tracking apps enable field scanning.|4.0|4.2
Which data sanitization method meets NIST SP 800-88 guidelines by overwriting data multiple times?|Delete files|Cryptographic erasure|Data wiping with multiple passes|Format drive|2|Data wiping with multiple passes overwrites data multiple times with random patterns meeting NIST SP 800-88 sanitization guidelines. Methods: (1) DoD 5220.22-M (3 passes: 0s, 1s, random), (2) Gutmann method (35 passes, overkill for modern drives), (3) Random overwrite (1-7 passes sufficient for most drives), (4) Vendor-specific commands (Secure Erase for SSDs uses firmware). NIST SP 800-88 recommends: HDDs - overwrite OR cryptographic erasure OR physical destruction, SSDs - cryptographic erasure OR physical destruction (overwriting less effective due to wear leveling). Tools: DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke), Eraser, shred (Linux), Blancco. Verification: read back data to confirm overwrite. Simple delete only removes pointers, format creates new file system structure but data recoverable. Wiping prevents forensic recovery meeting compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI DSS) for media reuse or donation.|4.0|4.2
What asset management practice tracks software licenses to prevent compliance violations and audits?|Ignore licenses|Software Asset Management (SAM) with license tracking|Use unlicensed software|Hope for the best|1|Software Asset Management (SAM) tracks software licenses ensuring compliance, optimizing costs, and preventing audit violations. Components: (1) License inventory (what licenses owned, quantities, types: perpetual/subscription/concurrent), (2) Software inventory (what installed where), (3) License compliance reconciliation (installations vs licenses), (4) License optimization (identify unused licenses for reallocation, eliminate redundant tools), (5) Audit preparation (vendor audits: Microsoft/Adobe/Oracle). Risks of non-compliance: fines (tens of thousands per violation), forced upgrades, legal action, reputational damage. Benefits: avoid over-licensing (wasted money), prevent under-licensing (compliance violations), negotiate better terms, track maintenance renewals. Tools: Flexera, Snow Software, ServiceNow SAM, Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center. Challenges: complex licensing (per user/device/core), cloud/SaaS license tracking, shadow IT unlicensed software. Regular software audits (quarterly) compare installed vs licensed.|4.0|4.2
Which disposal method physically destroys storage media into small particles preventing data recovery?|Donation|Physical shredding|Light cleaning|Selling intact|1|Physical shredding destroys storage media into particles too small for data recovery meeting NIST SP 800-88 physical destruction requirements. Specifications: (1) Hard drives shredded to <2mm particles per NSA requirements, (2) Paper/optical media to <6mm particles, (3) Industrial shredders with classification ratings (P-1 to P-7 for security levels). Process: (1) Remove asset tags/labels with sensitive info, (2) Feed into shredder, (3) Capture particles in secure container, (4) Document with certificate of destruction (date, serial numbers, weight, method, witness signatures), (5) Dispose of particles per environmental regulations. Alternatives: degaussing (magnetic media only), incineration (extreme heat), disintegration (pulverization), physical destruction with hammer/drill (less secure). When required: classified data, end-of-life without reuse, compliance mandates (healthcare HIPAA, finance), failed drives (can't wipe). Vendors: Iron Mountain, Shred-it provide mobile shredding with certificates. Cost vs wiping: shredding prevents reuse but guarantees data destruction.|4.0|4.2
What asset management process discovers all devices connected to network including unauthorized shadow IT?|Ignore unknown devices|Network enumeration and discovery|Assume inventory complete|Manual guessing|1|Network enumeration and discovery automatically identifies all devices connected to network revealing shadow IT and rogue devices. Techniques: (1) Active scanning (Nmap/Nessus probes hosts for open ports, services, OS fingerprinting), (2) Passive monitoring (analyzes existing traffic via NetFlow, SPAN ports, no probes), (3) SNMP queries (polls managed devices for inventory data), (4) Agent-based reporting (installed agents report to central system), (5) Network Access Control (NAC) interrogates during connection), (6) Cloud discovery (CASB identifies unauthorized cloud services via logs/APIs). Discovery tools: Lansweeper, PDQ Inventory, SolarWinds, Qualys, Tenable. Benefits: identify unauthorized devices (personal routers, rogue access points, IoT devices), detect shadow IT (unapproved cloud services, personal devices), maintain accurate inventory, compliance reporting. Challenges: encrypted traffic limits passive discovery, mobile devices connect/disconnect, IoT devices lack agents. Schedule regular scans (weekly) plus continuous passive monitoring. Discovered unauthorized devices trigger investigation and remediation.|4.0|4.2
Which asset disposal technique deletes encryption keys rendering data permanently unrecoverable?|Plaintext storage|Cryptographic erasure|Simple deletion|Formatting|1|Cryptographic erasure (also called crypto-shredding) destroys encryption keys making encrypted data permanently unrecoverable without physical destruction. Process: (1) Data stored encrypted at rest with strong encryption (AES-256), (2) Encryption keys stored separately (HSM, key management system), (3) At disposal, delete/destroy all copies of encryption keys, (4) Encrypted data becomes unintelligible without keys, (5) Can leave encrypted data on media (faster than wiping). NIST SP 800-88 recognizes cryptographic erasure as sanitization method for encrypted drives. Benefits: (1) Fast disposal (instant vs hours wiping), (2) Effective for SSDs (wear leveling makes wiping difficult), (3) Works for cloud data (can't physically destroy provider's drives), (4) Enables secure data center decommissioning. Requirements: proven strong encryption, keys never stored with data, key destruction must be verified, document encryption implementation for auditors. Use cases: cloud service termination, SED (Self-Encrypting Drives) sanitization, rapid data center decommissioning. BitLocker/LUKS with TPM enable cryptographic erasure for full disk encryption.|4.0|4.2
What mobile device deployment model provides company devices with user choice from approved options?|BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)|CYOD (Choose Your Own Device)|COBO (Corporate-Owned, Business Only)|Personal devices only|1|CYOD (Choose Your Own Device) offers employees choice from pre-approved corporate-owned devices (select iPhone or Android, specific laptop models) balancing user preference with IT control. Characteristics: (1) Company owns devices, (2) Limited choices from vetted/supported models, (3) MDM enrolled for management, (4) Standard security configurations, (5) IT provides support only for approved models, (6) Personal use policies vary. Benefits: employee satisfaction (choice), simplified support (limited models), bulk purchasing discounts, consistent security, easier MDM enrollment than BYOD. Compared to: BYOD (user owns, privacy concerns, inconsistent security), COPE (company owned, personal use allowed, no choice), COBO (business only, no personal use), COSU (single use, kiosks/POS). Implementation: device catalog with specifications/costs, approval workflow, automated provisioning, trade-in programs for upgrades. Typical offering: 3-5 laptop models, 2-3 smartphone models updated annually.|4.0|4.2
Which asset retirement step updates inventory systems removing disposed assets from active tracking?|Keep in inventory forever|Update records and remove from inventory|Ignore records|Duplicate entries|1|Update records and remove from inventory ensures disposed assets no longer tracked as active, maintaining inventory accuracy and preventing security gaps. Process: (1) Verify disposition (wiped/destroyed/sold/donated), (2) Update asset record with disposal date, method, authorization, certificate of destruction, (3) Change status to "Retired" or "Disposed", (4) Maintain historical record for audits (don't delete completely, retention 7+ years), (5) Remove from monitoring/management systems (antivirus, patch management, MDM), (6) Update CMDB removing dependencies, (7) Notify finance (asset depreciation, insurance), (8) Cancel associated licenses/subscriptions. Risks if not updated: false inventory counts, compliance issues (report inactive assets), security monitoring alerts for non-existent devices, license waste, failed change management (assume system still active). Audit trail: who disposed, when, authorization, method, witness. Periodic reconciliation between physical inventory and database identifies discrepancies. Integration: asset management with financial systems, ITSM tools, HR (employee departures trigger device returns).|4.0|4.2
What procurement security requirement ensures vendors notify organization of security incidents?|No notification|Breach notification clause in contracts|Ignore security issues|Vendor decides|1|Breach notification clause in contracts requires vendors notify organization of security incidents within specified timeframe protecting organization from supply chain risks. Contract terms: (1) Notification timeline (24-72 hours of discovery), (2) Incident types covered (data breaches, unauthorized access, ransomware, vulnerabilities), (3) Information required (what happened, data affected, mitigation, timeline), (4) Communication method (security team contact, not just account manager), (5) Cooperation with investigation, (6) Customer notification assistance. Why critical: vendor breaches expose organization data (SolarWinds 2020, Kaseya 2021), delayed notification increases damage, compliance requirements (GDPR 72 hours), enables incident response. Additional contract security terms: right to audit, security standards adherence (SOC 2), liability for breaches, insurance requirements, data handling/deletion, subcontractor disclosure. Vendor risk management: assess vendor security pre-contract, ongoing monitoring, vendor security questionnaires (CAIQ, SIG), fourth-party risk (vendor's vendors). TPRM (Third-Party Risk Management) programs formalize vendor security.|4.0|4.2
Which asset tracking metric measures time from acquisition to disposal?|Utilization rate|Asset lifecycle duration|Replacement frequency|Purchase cost only|1|Asset lifecycle duration measures total time from acquisition to disposal informing replacement planning, budgeting, and lifecycle management. Typical lifecycles: (1) Laptops/desktops: 3-5 years, (2) Servers: 4-7 years (warranty/support dependent), (3) Network equipment: 5-10 years, (4) Mobile devices: 2-3 years (rapid obsolescence), (5) Printers: 5-7 years. Tracking benefits: (1) Budget forecasting (predict replacement costs), (2) EOL planning (security risk from unsupported systems), (3) Warranty management (replace before warranty expires), (4) Standardization (refresh cycles for consistent fleet), (5) TCO analysis (longer lifecycle may increase support costs). Metrics: average age by category, percentage past lifecycle, upcoming refresh requirements. Factors reducing lifecycle: obsolescence, vendor support termination (Microsoft ends Windows support), failure rates increasing with age, inability to run modern software/security tools. Lifecycle management: track acquisition dates, monitor vendor EOL announcements, plan replacements before failures, standardize refresh cycles departmentally. Tools: CMDB stores lifecycle metadata.|4.0|4.2
What disposal verification document proves assets properly sanitized and destroyed?|No documentation|Certificate of Destruction (CoD)|Informal note|Verbal confirmation|1|Certificate of Destruction (CoD) provides auditable proof that assets properly sanitized or destroyed meeting compliance requirements. Contents: (1) Organization details (customer name, address), (2) Destruction details (date, method: shredding/degaussing/incineration, location), (3) Asset list (serial numbers, asset tags, quantities, descriptions), (4) Weight of materials destroyed, (5) Standards compliance (NIST SP 800-88, DoD 5220.22-M, HIPAA, PCI DSS), (6) Signatures (vendor representative, witness, optional customer representative), (7) Chain of custody documentation. Why required: (1) Compliance audits (prove proper disposal for PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX), (2) Legal protection (defend against data breach claims), (3) Environmental regulations (proper e-waste disposal), (4) Insurance requirements, (5) Financial reporting (asset write-offs). Vendor services: Iron Mountain, Shred-it, Stericycle provide on-site or off-site destruction with CoD. Best practice: require CoD for all sensitive asset disposal, maintain minimum 7 years, photograph disposal for additional proof, video on-site shredding. Lack of CoD creates compliance gaps and liability risks.|4.0|4.2
Which asset management practice assigns specific individuals responsibility for assets?|Group ownership|Custodian assignment and accountability|No accountability|Anonymous usage|1|Custodian assignment and accountability assigns specific individuals responsibility for asset security, appropriate use, and return creating accountability chain. Custodian responsibilities: (1) Physical security (secure storage, prevent theft), (2) Report loss/damage immediately, (3) Appropriate use per acceptable use policy, (4) Don't share credentials/access, (5) Maintain asset condition, (6) Return upon separation/transfer, (7) Permit only authorized users. Implementation: (1) Asset assignment form (employee signs accepting responsibility), (2) Track in asset database (custodian field, assignment date), (3) Regular reconciliation (verify custodian still has asset), (4) Financial accountability (deduct replacement cost if lost/damaged through negligence), (5) Automated alerts (return deadlines, expired assignments), (6) HR integration (termination workflow triggers asset return). Benefits: reduced loss/theft (someone accountable), improved recovery rates, clear responsibility for security, simplified audits. Contrast shared assets (conference room projectors) with corporate custodian or department. Lost assets trigger investigation, possible disciplinary action, replacement costs. Exit checklist ensures all assigned assets returned before final paycheck.|4.0|4.2
What automated asset discovery method interrogates devices during network connection requiring compliance before access?|Post-connection scanning|Network Access Control (NAC) pre-admission interrogation|No verification|Periodic audits only|1|Network Access Control (NAC) pre-admission interrogation queries devices during connection attempt, enforcing compliance before granting network access. NAC workflow: (1) Device attempts connection (wired 802.1X or wireless), (2) NAC agent or agentless scan interrogates (OS version, patch level, antivirus status, disk encryption, firewall enabled, unauthorized apps), (3) Compare against policy (must have antivirus, patches within 30 days, encrypted drives), (4) Grant access (compliant), quarantine VLAN (non-compliant for remediation), or block (severe violations), (5) Continuous monitoring (persistent agent checks ongoing compliance). Agent-based NAC: installed software provides detailed inventory, works offline, requires deployment/maintenance. Agentless NAC: network-based scanning or 802.1X EAP inspection, no installation, less detail. Use cases: prevent malware-infected devices connecting, enforce BYOD compliance, protect guest networks, IoT device isolation. Vendors: Cisco ISE, Aruba ClearPass, ForeScout. Benefits: real-time compliance enforcement, automated remediation, visibility into all connected devices. Challenge: IoT devices may lack NAC agent capability requiring MAC-based bypass with segmentation.|4.0|4.2
Which asset classification level requires highest security controls and restricted access?|Public|Internal Use|Confidential|Top Secret/Classified|3|Top Secret/Classified assets require maximum security controls with extremely restricted access to prevent exceptionally grave damage from disclosure. Controls: (1) Physical security (safes, vaults, secured facilities with armed guards, biometric access, mantrap entries), (2) Background checks (Top Secret clearance requires extensive investigation, polygraph for some positions), (3) Need-to-know basis (clearance insufficient, must have legitimate business need), (4) Encryption at rest and in transit (FIPS 140-2 Level 3+ validated), (5) Dedicated networks (air-gapped from internet), (6) Continuous monitoring (all access logged, behavior analytics, USB disabled), (7) Secure destruction (classified shredders/incinerators, witnessed destruction), (8) Compartmentalization (Sensitive Compartmented Information - SCI restricts even within Top Secret). Marking requirements: cover sheets, headers/footers, watermarks, document registers. Spillage events (classified data on unclassified systems) trigger security incidents. Government/military classification; corporate equivalents: Crown Jewels, Executive Confidential. Example: NSA classified programs, nuclear weapon designs, covert agent identities. Unauthorized disclosure: espionage charges, decades imprisonment.|4.0|4.2
What procurement practice requires multiple vendor quotes to ensure competitive pricing and reduce fraud risk?|Single source no-bid|Competitive bidding with multiple quotes|Favoritism|Informal selection|1|Competitive bidding with multiple quotes requires soliciting proposals from multiple vendors ensuring competitive pricing, reducing corruption/favoritism, and improving quality. Process: (1) Requirements definition (detailed specifications, quantities, delivery requirements), (2) RFP (Request for Proposal) or RFQ (Request for Quote) issued to qualified vendors, (3) Evaluation criteria defined (price weight 30-50%, technical capabilities, security posture, support, references), (4) Vendor proposals submitted (sealed bids for fairness), (5) Evaluation team scores proposals, (6) Award to best value (not always lowest price), (7) Contract negotiation. Typical requirements: 3 quotes for purchases $5K-$50K, formal RFP for $50K+. Benefits: market pricing (prevent overcharging), vendor competition improves offers, audit trail, fraud prevention (harder to favor specific vendor), better terms. Exceptions: sole source (only one vendor), proprietary compatibility, emergency purchases, existing contracts. Procurement policy defines thresholds and approval authorities. Security considerations in evaluation: vendor certifications (ISO 27001/SOC 2), security features, patch management, EOL timelines, data handling. Kickbacks and bid-rigging prevented through competitive process.|4.0|4.2
Which asset management metric calculates total cost including purchase, maintenance, support, and disposal?|Purchase price only|Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)|Monthly cost|Replacement cost|1|Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculates complete asset cost over lifecycle including acquisition, operation, maintenance, support, and disposal. TCO components: (1) Acquisition (hardware, software licenses, shipping, installation, training), (2) Operation (power, cooling, network bandwidth, cloud subscriptions), (3) Maintenance (hardware failures, warranty extensions, spare parts), (4) Support (helpdesk, IT staff time, vendor support contracts), (5) Software (patches, upgrades, license renewals), (6) Security (antivirus, EDR, compliance tools), (7) Disposal (data sanitization, recycling fees, certificates of destruction), (8) Opportunity cost (staff time managing). TCO analysis: compare laptop $1200 purchase vs 3-year TCO $3500 (support/repairs/software/disposal). Cloud vs on-prem TCO: cloud reduces capital expenditure but increases operational expense, include staff training, integration, egress fees. TCO informs decisions: extend lifecycle vs refresh, repair vs replace, cloud vs on-prem, outsource vs in-house. Tools: Gartner TCO calculators, spreadsheet modeling. Common mistake: focusing only on purchase price ignoring operational costs.|4.0|4.2
What asset dependency mapping technique identifies which systems depend on specific assets?|Ignore dependencies|Configuration Item (CI) relationship mapping in CMDB|Assume nothing connected|Informal knowledge only|1|Configuration Item (CI) relationship mapping in CMDB documents dependencies between assets enabling impact analysis for changes, incidents, and failures. Relationship types: (1) Runs on (application runs on server), (2) Depends on (web server depends on database), (3) Hosted by (VM hosted by hypervisor), (4) Connected to (server connected to switch), (5) Uses (application uses API), (6) Installed on (software installed on OS), (7) Communicates with (microservice communicates with authentication service). Benefits: (1) Change impact analysis (know what breaks if upgrade database), (2) Incident management (identify root cause, understand blast radius), (3) Disaster recovery planning (prioritize systems based on dependencies), (4) Capacity planning (understand resource dependencies), (5) Decommissioning (ensure no dependencies before removing). Discovery: application dependency mapping (ADM) tools, network flow analysis, service modeling, database relationship discovery. Tools: ServiceNow CMDB, Device42, BMC Discovery. Example: e-commerce checkout depends on payment gateway + inventory database + authentication service + email notification - mapping identifies critical path. Maintain accuracy through automated discovery and change management process updating relationships.|4.0|4.2
Which mobile device security feature allows organizations to remotely locate lost or stolen devices?|No tracking|GPS tracking and device location services|Physical search only|Hope for return|1|GPS tracking and device location services enable organizations remotely locate lost/stolen devices facilitating recovery or triggering remote wipe. Capabilities: (1) Real-time location (latitude/longitude, address, map view), (2) Location history (track movement over time), (3) Geofencing alerts (notify if device leaves authorized area), (4) Lost mode (displays message with contact info, locks device, tracks location), (5) Trigger actions (sound alarm even if silenced, take photo of thief, remote wipe if recovery impossible). Platform features: Apple Find My (iCloud), Google Find My Device, Microsoft Find My Device, third-party MDM location tracking. Privacy considerations: employee consent required (BYOD), monitor only during work hours or always (policy decision), data retention policies, legal implications of tracking. Use cases: (1) Recover lost devices (left in taxi/conference room), (2) Theft investigation (provide location to police), (3) Remote wipe if in wrong hands, (4) Verify employee location (field workers, company vehicles). Limitations: requires network/GPS enabled, indoors less accurate, can be defeated by factory reset if not MDM locked. Balance security against privacy - clear policy about when/how tracking used.|4.0|4.2
What asset decommissioning step transfers retired hardware to new owners with proper documentation?|Throw away|Chain of custody transfer with documentation|Give away informally|Sell without records|1|Chain of custody transfer with documentation creates auditable trail when transferring retired assets to new owners (buyers, donation recipients, recyclers, destruction vendors). Documentation: (1) Asset details (make, model, serial number, asset tag, original cost), (2) Sanitization certificate (method, date, standard met, verification), (3) Transfer authorization (approving manager, justification), (4) Recipient information (company name, contact, receiving signature), (5) Transfer date and location, (6) Condition assessment (functional, damaged, for parts), (7) Data removal attestation (no data remains), (8) Liability release (AS-IS condition, no warranty). Why critical: (1) Compliance audits (prove proper disposal), (2) Legal protection (defend against data breach from transferred asset), (3) Tax documentation (donation deductions, asset write-offs), (4) Financial reporting (disposal gains/losses), (5) Insurance claims (theft/loss documentation), (6) Warranty/support transitions. Recipients: e-waste recyclers (R2/e-Stewards certified), charities (schools, nonprofits receive sanitized equipment), resellers/brokers, employees (purchase programs). Best practice: photograph assets during transfer, obtain signed receipt, maintain 7+ years records. Lost chain of custody creates compliance liability.|4.0|4.2
Which asset tracking system uses small radio chips to automatically identify assets without line-of-sight?|Barcode only|RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)|Manual logs|GPS only|1|RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) uses radio waves to automatically identify and track assets via small tags without requiring line-of-sight or manual scanning. RFID components: (1) Tags (passive powered by reader 10-30 feet, active with battery 300+ feet), (2) Readers (emit radio waves, receive tag responses, fixed portals or handheld), (3) Middleware (processes tag data), (4) Database (asset management system integration). Benefits vs barcodes: (1) No line-of-sight needed (scan through boxes, clothing, on people), (2) Bulk reading (hundreds of tags simultaneously), (3) Longer range (passive 30 feet vs barcode inches), (4) Read/write capability (update tag data), (5) Faster scanning (entire pallet in seconds). Use cases: inventory management (retail, warehouse), access control (badge readers), asset tracking (hospital equipment, IT assets, tools), supply chain (pallets, containers), library books, livestock tracking. Frequency bands: LF (low frequency 125 KHz short range), HF (13.56 MHz NFC range), UHF (865-960 MHz long range for inventory). Privacy concerns: potential tracking of people, tag deactivation after purchase, signal shielding (Faraday bags). Cost higher than barcodes but ROI from automation.|4.0|4.2
What procurement requirement ensures purchased hardware/software receives security updates for adequate duration?|No support required|Vendor support lifecycle and EOL timeline verification|Assume perpetual updates|Hope for patches|1|Vendor support lifecycle and EOL (End of Life) timeline verification ensures purchased assets receive security updates for expected operational lifespan preventing orphaned vulnerable systems. Pre-purchase evaluation: (1) Vendor support policy (how long updates provided), (2) Product lifecycle (current version age, next version timeline), (3) Historical support duration (how long previous versions supported), (4) EOL announcement process (advance notice period), (5) Extended support availability and cost, (6) Migration path to newer versions, (7) Community support if vendor EOL. Minimum requirements: support duration â‰¥ expected asset lifecycle (e.g., 5-year server needs 5+ year support). Red flags: product near EOL (Windows 7 approaching 2020 EOL shouldn't be purchased in 2019), vendor financial instability, acquired company with unclear support commitment, proprietary hardware with single vendor lock-in. Examples: Windows 10 support ends Oct 2025, Ubuntu LTS 5 years, Cisco TAC support requires active maintenance contract. Risk of ignoring: zero-day vulnerabilities unpatched, compliance violations (PCI DSS requires patching), forced expensive migrations, compensating controls can't fully mitigate. Document expected support duration in requirements, include in vendor evaluation scoring.|4.0|4.2
Which asset management policy defines acceptable employee use of company equipment?|No policy|Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)|Informal guidelines|Manager preference|1|Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) defines authorized employee use of company IT assets (computers, mobile devices, network, email, internet) establishing expectations and consequences for violations. AUP contents: (1) Permitted uses (work-related activities, limited reasonable personal use), (2) Prohibited uses (illegal activity, harassment, pornography, unauthorized software, unauthorized device connections, copyright violations, competitive business), (3) Security requirements (passwords, screen locks, don't share credentials, report incidents), (4) Monitoring disclosure (organization may monitor usage, no privacy expectation), (5) Data handling (sensitive data protection, no personal storage of work data), (6) Social media guidelines (represent company appropriately, don't disclose confidential info), (7) BYOD if applicable (separation of work/personal, consent to remote wipe), (8) Consequences (violations may result in discipline up to termination, legal action). Implementation: (1) All employees acknowledge acceptance (signed or electronic), (2) Include in onboarding, (3) Annual review/reacknowledgement, (4) Enforce consistently, (5) Training on policy. Legal considerations: AUP provides legal standing to monitor, terminate for violations, protect in lawsuits. Violations: downloading illegal content, using resources for personal business, circumventing security controls.|4.0|4.2
What asset retirement criterion triggers disposal when repair costs exceed replacement value?|Always repair|Economic lifecycle end - repair cost > replacement cost|Never dispose|Fix at any cost|1|Economic lifecycle end occurs when asset repair/maintenance costs exceed replacement value making disposal and replacement more economical than continued operation. Decision factors: (1) Repair estimate (parts + labor), (2) Replacement cost (new/refurbished equivalent), (3) Remaining useful life after repair (if repair only extends 6 months but replacement lasts 3 years), (4) Downtime costs (lengthy repairs cause business disruption), (5) Opportunity cost (newer systems more efficient/secure), (6) TCO comparison (old systems higher support costs), (7) Warranty status (out of warranty repairs expensive). Example: laptop motherboard failure $800 repair vs $1000 new laptop with warranty = replace. However: critical legacy systems (no replacement available), specialized equipment (expensive regardless), may justify continued repairs. Calculate break-even: if server requires $3000 annual maintenance and replacement costs $9000 with 5-year lifecycle, replacement TCO lower. Fleet considerations: standardize refresh cycles vs repair individually (bulk purchasing advantages). Sunk cost fallacy: prior investment irrelevant to forward-looking decision.

Which inventory audit practice physically verifies assets match database records?|Trust database only|Physical inventory reconciliation|Assume records accurate|Never verify|1|Physical inventory reconciliation physically verifies assets match database records identifying discrepancies from theft, loss, unauthorized disposal, or record errors. Process: (1) Define scope (all assets or sample by category/location/risk), (2) Schedule (annual full inventory, quarterly high-value items), (3) Freeze database (no changes during count), (4) Physical count team scans/records all assets (barcodes/RFID), (5) Compare physical count to database records, (6) Investigate discrepancies (missing assets: stolen/disposed unreported/transferred unrecorded, extra assets: unrecorded purchases/shadow IT/personal devices), (7) Update database (add missing records, remove disposed assets, correct locations), (8) Report findings (discrepancy rate, value of missing assets, trends), (9) Remediate (tighten controls, disciplinary action, improve procedures). Regulatory requirements: Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) requires inventory controls, financial audits verify asset existence. Sampling approach: 100% high-value assets (servers, laptops), statistical sample of lower value (peripherals). Cycle counts (count different assets throughout year) less disruptive than annual full inventory. Discrepancy thresholds: >5% indicates control weakness. Technology: mobile scanning apps streamline counts, RFID enables automated inventory (walk through with reader).|4.0|4.2
What asset management integration links IT asset data with financial accounting for depreciation tracking?|No integration|IT Asset Management (ITAM) and Financial Management integration|Separate systems forever|Manual reconciliation only|1|IT Asset Management (ITAM) and Financial Management integration synchronizes IT asset data with financial accounting systems ensuring accurate depreciation, capitalization, and financial reporting. Data synchronized: (1) Asset acquisition (purchase date, cost, vendor), (2) Asset details (make, model, serial number, asset tag), (3) Depreciation (method: straight-line/declining balance, useful life, current book value), (4) Disposal (disposal date, disposal proceeds, gain/loss calculation), (5) Capitalization threshold (expenses <$5000 typically expensed not capitalized), (6) Cost center allocation (charge departments for asset costs). Benefits: (1) Accurate financial statements (balance sheet asset values), (2) Tax compliance (proper depreciation for taxes), (3) Audit preparedness (reconcile IT inventory to general ledger), (4) Chargeback/showback (allocate IT costs to business units), (5) Budget forecasting (replacement cycle planning), (6) Insurance (accurate asset values for coverage). Integration methods: API integration (ServiceNow to SAP), file exports/imports, single platform (ERP with ITAM module). Challenges: IT tracks technical details (configurations), Finance tracks cost (acquisition value, depreciation), require common asset identifier linking records. Periodic reconciliation: compare IT asset list to fixed asset register, investigate discrepancies (IT shows disposed but Finance still capitalizing).|4.0|4.2
Which secure disposal method renders magnetic storage media unreadable by disrupting magnetic fields?|Formatting|Degaussing|Deleting files|Virus scanning|1|Degaussing exposes magnetic storage media (HDDs, magnetic tapes) to powerful magnetic fields (thousands of gauss) permanently disrupting magnetic domains rendering data unrecoverable. Degaussing process: (1) Place media in degausser (conveyor belt or manual), (2) Device generates powerful magnetic field (20,000+ gauss), (3) Field randomizes magnetic particles destroying data and servo tracks, (4) Drive permanently unusable (can't reformat or reuse), (5) Document with serial numbers for audit trail. Types: (1) High-energy degaussers (destroy high-coercivity modern drives), (2) Wand degaussers (manual, portable), (3) Conveyor degaussers (automated high-volume). Standards: NSA/CSS EPL (Evaluated Products List) certifies degaussers for classified media. Limitations: (1) Doesn't work on SSDs/flash memory (no magnetic storage), (2) Destroys drive (no reuse unlike wiping), (3) Expensive equipment ($5,000-$30,000), (4) Verify degausser strength sufficient for modern high-density drives. Alternative: physical destruction (shredding/crushing) works on all media types. When required: classified media disposal, failed drives (can't wipe), rapid disposal without time for wiping. Verify with data recovery attempt after degaussing. Degaussed drives recycled for materials only.|4.0|4.2
What asset procurement control requires separation between requestor and approver preventing fraud?|Self-approval|Segregation of duties (requestor â‰  approver)|Same person does everything|No approval needed|1|Segregation of duties (SoD) in procurement requires different individuals for requesting, approving, receiving, and paying preventing fraud, errors, and conflicts of interest. Procurement roles separated: (1) Requestor (initiates purchase, defines requirements), (2) Approver (reviews business justification, budget availability, vendor selection), (3) Receiver (physically receives and inspects goods matching purchase order), (4) Invoice processor (accounting verifies invoice matches PO and receipt), (5) Payment approver (authorizes payment after verification). Why critical: prevents (1) Kickback schemes (requestor chooses vendor giving kickbacks, approves own request), (2) Embezzlement (order personal items using company funds), (3) Fictitious vendors (create fake company, approve purchases to self), (4) Inflated invoices (collude with vendor for higher prices, pocket difference). Implementation: (1) Different staff for each role (not always different departments but separate individuals), (2) System enforces (ERP prevents self-approval), (3) Approval thresholds ($0-$5K manager, $5K-$50K director, $50K+ VP), (4) Random audits. Exception: small organizations with limited staff require compensating controls (detailed audit trail, external audits). Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) mandates SoD for financial transactions. Similar principle for asset disposal (requestor â‰  disposal approver).|4.0|4.2
Which asset tracking metric identifies assets approaching vendor support termination?|Utilization percentage|Time to End-of-Life (EOL)/End-of-Support (EOS)|Power consumption|Physical location|1|Time to End-of-Life (EOL) / End-of-Support (EOS) metric identifies assets approaching vendor support termination enabling proactive replacement or mitigation before security vulnerabilities go unpatched. Tracking: (1) Vendor EOL databases (check manufacturer sites for announcements), (2) Asset management integration (flag assets with EOL within 12-18 months), (3) Dashboard visualization (red assets <6 months, yellow 6-12 months, green >12 months), (4) Automated alerts (notify IT/management when assets reach thresholds). EOL vs EOS: EOL (complete discontinuation, no parts/sales), EOS (no more updates/patches, may still sell). Critical for security: unsupported systems don't receive security patches (WannaCry exploited unsupported Windows XP). Examples: Windows 7 EOL Jan 2020, Windows Server 2012 EOL Oct 2023, Cisco IOS versions EOL per product lifecycle. Response strategies: (1) Proactive replacement (migrate before EOL), (2) Extended support (vendors offer paid extended support, expensive), (3) Compensating controls (isolate unsupported systems, enhanced monitoring, IPS), (4) Virtual patching (IPS/WAF rules protect until migration). Budget planning: EOL reports drive capital expenditure forecasts for refresh cycles. Quarterly review: vendor EOL announcements, update asset database, add to replacement roadmap. PCI DSS explicitly requires replacing/upgrading unsupported systems.|4.0|4.2
What mobile device security policy addresses employees using personal devices for work?|No policy|BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy|Ban all personal devices|Ignore personal devices|1|BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy establishes requirements when employees use personal smartphones/laptops for work balancing security, privacy, and productivity. Policy components: (1) Eligibility (which roles, which devices types/OS versions allowed), (2) MDM enrollment (required for work email/data access), (3) Security requirements (passcode complexity, encryption, antivirus, OS updates within 30 days), (4) Containerization (separate work/personal data, corporate wipe removes only work container), (5) Acceptable use (no jailbreaking/rooting, no storing work data in personal cloud), (6) Privacy disclosure (organization may monitor work activity, not personal), (7) Support (IT supports work apps only, not personal device issues), (8) Incident response (must report lost/stolen within 2 hours), (9) Consequences (non-compliance = loss of work access, work data wiped before separation). Benefits: employee satisfaction (preferred devices), CAPEX reduction (no company device purchases), productivity (employees already know devices). Risks: personal device compromise affects work data, limited control vs company-owned, privacy concerns (employee pushback against monitoring). Legal: require signed agreement acknowledging remote wipe consent, monitoring disclosure. Alternative models: COPE (company-owned, personal use), CYOD (choose from company options) provide more control.|4.0|4.2
Which asset documentation practice maintains detailed records of hardware configurations and software installations?|No documentation|Configuration baseline documentation|Informal memory|Assume default settings|1|Configuration baseline documentation records approved standard configurations for asset categories ensuring consistency, security, and supportability. Baseline contents: (1) Hardware specifications (make, model, RAM, storage, ports enabled/disabled), (2) Operating system (version, edition, patches, features enabled/removed), (3) Security settings (firewall rules, antivirus, encryption, user rights), (4) Software inventory (approved applications, versions), (5) Network configuration (IP addressing, DNS, NTP, VLAN), (6) Security hardening (CIS Benchmark level, services disabled, default accounts removed), (7) Naming convention (hostname structure), (8) Monitoring agents (antivirus, EDR, log forwarding, backup agent). Benefits: (1) Consistent deployments (gold images, infrastructure as code), (2) Configuration audits (detect drift from baseline), (3) Troubleshooting (compare working vs broken), (4) Change management (understand impact of changes), (5) Disaster recovery (rebuild to known-good state), (6) Compliance (demonstrate security controls). Implementation: (1) Document baselines for each asset category (Windows 10 workstation, Ubuntu server, Cisco switch), (2) Store in CMDB or wiki, (3) Version control (update when baseline changes), (4) Configuration management tools enforce (Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Group Policy). Auditing: configuration compliance scanning (Nessus, Qualys) compares actual to baseline, reports deviations. Baseline exceptions: document and approve (legacy app requires old Java version).|4.0|4.2
What asset disposal consideration addresses proper handling of hazardous electronic waste?|Trash disposal|Environmental compliance (e-waste regulations)|Ignore environmental impact|Landfill everything|1|Environmental compliance requires proper e-waste disposal per regulations preventing toxic materials (lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, beryllium) from contaminating environment. Regulations: (1) US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) guidelines, (2) State laws (California strict e-waste regulations), (3) EU WEEE Directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment), (4) Basel Convention (restricts hazardous waste exports to developing countries), (5) Local ordinances (banned from regular trash in many jurisdictions). Compliant disposal: (1) Certified recyclers (R2 or e-Stewards certification, audit trail from collection to materials recovery), (2) Manufacturer take-back programs (Dell, HP, Apple accept old equipment), (3) Retailer recycling (Best Buy, Staples), (4) Municipal e-waste collection events, (5) Donate (working equipment to nonprofits via Goodwill, schools). Hazardous components: CRT monitors (lead in glass), batteries (lithium fire risk, heavy metals), circuit boards (brominated flame retardants), fluorescent backlights (mercury). Benefits compliant disposal: (1) Avoid fines (thousands per violation), (2) Material recovery (metals recycled), (3) Corporate social responsibility, (4) Employee safety (prevent exposure to toxins). Process: (1) Data sanitization first (security), (2) Sort by material type, (3) Partner with certified recycler, (4) Certificate of recycling documenting environmental compliance.|4.0|4.2
Which asset inventory field tracks warranty expiration enabling proactive renewal or replacement?|Purchase location|Warranty end date|Employee preference|Marketing materials|1|Warranty end date tracking enables proactive maintenance contract renewals or replacement decisions before support lapses creating vulnerabilities and downtime risks. Warranty information tracked: (1) Warranty duration (1-3 years typical, 5+ for servers), (2) Warranty level (basic/next-business-day/same-day/4-hour, on-site vs depot), (3) Coverage scope (parts, labor, wear items), (4) Warranty start/end dates, (5) Warranty provider (manufacturer, reseller, third-party), (6) Warranty cost (warranty extension pricing), (7) Service tag/serial numbers (for warranty lookups). Benefits: (1) Avoid expensive out-of-warranty repairs ($800 laptop motherboard replacement vs $200 under warranty), (2) Downtime prevention (in-warranty systems repaired faster), (3) Renewal timing (evaluate renewal 60-90 days before expiration), (4) Replacement decisions (if warranty expires soon and repairs needed, replace instead), (5) Budget planning (forecasting warranty renewals or replacements), (6) Vendor management (track warranty claim success rates). Automation: (1) Alert 90 days pre-expiration, (2) Manufacturer APIs check warranty status (Dell, HP provide APIs), (3) Integrate with service desk (warranty info in incident tickets), (4) Reports (upcoming warranty expirations by quarter). Strategy: critical systems maintain warranty throughout lifecycle, non-critical may run without warranty accepting repair risk. Extended warranties: cost/benefit analysis (are extended warranties worth premium vs self-insuring).|4.0|4.2
What procurement practice evaluates vendor financial stability preventing supply chain disruption from vendor bankruptcy?|Skip evaluation|Vendor financial health assessment|Trust all vendors|Ignore vendor viability|1|Vendor financial health assessment evaluates vendor viability preventing supply chain disruption, lost access to critical systems, and stranded assets if vendor fails. Assessment factors: (1) Financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow - publicly traded easily available, private require request), (2) Credit rating (Dun & Bradstreet rating, S&P/Moody's for public companies), (3) Profitability (revenue growth, profit margins, operating income), (4) Debt levels (high debt increases bankruptcy risk), (5) Industry position (market share, competitive threats), (6) Recent news (layoffs, executive departures, lawsuits, acquisition rumors), (7) Customer references (existing customers satisfied, vendor responsive), (8) Years in business (startups higher risk but sometimes necessary), (9) Funding (venture-backed startups: funding runway, burn rate). Risks of vendor failure: (1) Lost support (software/hardware no updates), (2) Hostage situations (SaaS vendor shutdowns, data retrieval difficulties), (3) Acquisition (new owner changes terms, discontinues products), (4) Locked proprietary data (no export capability). Mitigation: (1) Escrow agreements (source code held by third-party released if vendor fails), (2) Exit strategy (data export plan, migration path to alternatives), (3) Diversification (avoid single vendor dependencies), (4) Contractual protections (transition assistance, data return). Procurement minimum: established vendors for critical systems, accept higher risk for non-critical. Monitor vendor health ongoing quarterly.|4.0|4.2
Which asset management principle requires documenting approvals and changes throughout asset lifecycle?|Informal processes|Audit trail and documentation|Verbal approval only|No records needed|1|Audit trail and documentation creates comprehensive record of asset lifecycle events enabling compliance audits, forensic investigations, and accountability. Documented events: (1) Acquisition (requisition, approval, purchase order, receipt, payment), (2) Assignment (who received, when, signed acknowledgment of responsibility), (3) Transfers (between employees, locations, departments with authorization), (4) Configurations (changes to hardware, software, settings with change tickets), (5) Maintenance (repairs, upgrades, costs, vendor service records), (6) Incidents (damage, loss, theft with incident reports), (7) Disposal (authorization, method, certificate of destruction, environmental compliance). Documentation requirements: (1) Who (actor identity), (2) What (action taken), (3) When (timestamp), (4) Why (justification/authorization), (5) How (method), (6) Supporting evidence (signatures, certificates, photos). Benefits: (1) Compliance (prove controls for audits: SOX, ISO 27001, PCI DSS), (2) Investigations (forensic timeline for asset compromise), (3) Financial (support asset values, depreciation, write-offs), (4) Legal (defend against disputes, litigation), (5) Accountability (identify responsibility for losses). Retention: maintain 7+ years (legal statute of limitations), longer for critical assets. Technology: ITSM tools (ServiceNow) automate documentation, digital signatures, workflow approvals. Immutable logs prevent tampering. Regular audits verify documentation completeness and accuracy.|4.0|4.2
What mobile device management feature prevents jailbroken or rooted devices from accessing corporate resources?|Allow all devices|Device compliance checking and enforcement|Hope devices secure|No verification|1|Device compliance checking and enforcement validates mobile device security posture before granting corporate resource access blocking compromised (jailbroken/rooted) devices. Checks performed: (1) Jailbreak/root detection (iOS jailbreak indicators, Android root indicators via SafetyNet/Play Integrity API), (2) OS version (require minimum version with security patches), (3) Encryption status (full device encryption enabled), (4) Screen lock (passcode enabled, biometric with PIN backup), (5) MDM enrollment (device managed by corporate MDM), (6) Prohibited apps (no torrenting, unauthorized remote access), (7) Security patches (within 90 days of release), (8) Device model (block unsupported or insecure models). Enforcement actions: (1) Block access (non-compliant devices can't connect to Exchange, VPN, corporate apps), (2) Quarantine (limited access to remediation resources like company portal for updates), (3) Alert user (notification with remediation steps), (4) Alert IT (security team investigates rooted devices). Jailbreak/root risks: (1) Removes OS security protections (sandboxing, code signing), (2) Enables malware installation, (3) Bypasses MDM controls, (4) Certificate pinning bypass enables MitM attacks. Implementation: Conditional Access policies (Azure AD), MDM compliance policies (Intune, Workspace ONE, MobileIron). User experience: compliant devices seamless access, non-compliant prompted to remediate. Banking apps also detect jailbreak/root refusing to run.|4.0|4.2
Which asset procurement requirement ensures purchased solutions integrate with existing security infrastructure?|Ignore integration|Compatibility and interoperability validation|Assume everything works together|Buy without testing|1|Compatibility and interoperability validation ensures purchased assets integrate with existing infrastructure preventing costly replacements, security gaps, and operational disruptions. Validation areas: (1) Security tools (new EDR integrates with SIEM, new firewall exports logs to log aggregation), (2) Authentication (supports SAML/LDAP for SSO with Active Directory/Azure AD), (3) Operating systems (supports current OS versions Windows 11, RHEL 8), (4) Network infrastructure (compatible with existing switching/VPN, proper VLAN support), (5) APIs (documented APIs for automation/integration), (6) Management tools (agent compatibility with current management platforms), (7) Data formats (imports/exports standard formats, no proprietary lock-in), (8) Compliance frameworks (supports required standards: FIPS 140-2, Common Criteria). Testing methods: (1) Proof of Concept (POC - vendor provides trial for testing), (2) Lab testing (deploy in test environment), (3) Vendor demonstrations (validate specific requirements), (4) Reference architectures (vendor provides integration guides), (5) Customer references (talk to similar organizations about integration experiences). Integration failures: purchased firewalls can't export logs in required format (need expensive connector), new app doesn't support SAML (requires separate credentials), incompatible patch management (can't manage new servers). RFP requirements: "must integrate with X via Y protocol", technical evaluation criteria include integration capabilities. Avoid vendor lock-in: standards-based solutions (APIs, open protocols) enable future flexibility.|4.0|4.2
What asset classification label warns that unauthorized disclosure causes serious damage?|Public|Internal Use|Confidential|Restricted|2|Confidential classification indicates unauthorized disclosure causes serious damage to organization requiring substantial protection. Confidential characteristics: (1) Serious damage from disclosure (vs exceptionally grave for Top Secret, limited for Internal Use), (2) Restricted distribution (only personnel with need-to-know), (3) Protection requirements (encryption at rest/transit, secure transmission, access logging), (4) Handling (can't be taken home without approval, secure storage when unattended), (5) Disposal (cross-cut shredding, certified destruction for digital media), (6) Transmission (encrypted email, secure file transfer, no personal email/cloud). Examples: (1) Customer data (PII, payment information), (2) Trade secrets (product formulas, manufacturing processes), (3) Financial data (budgets, contracts, M&A negotiations), (4) Employee data (SSN, salaries, performance reviews), (5) Security architecture (network diagrams, vulnerability assessments), (6) Intellectual property (source code, patents pending). Marking: "Confidential" header/footer, watermarks, cover sheets, controlled distribution lists. Access controls: need-to-know basis (not everyone with clearance level automatically gets access), data encryption, DLP monitoring, user access reviews. Contrast: Public (no harm), Internal Use Only (minimal harm), Top Secret (exceptionally grave damage). Confidential most common classification for business-sensitive information. Training: employees recognize and protect properly, spillage incidents (Confidential data in wrong classification) trigger remediation.|4.0|4.2
Which asset retirement verification ensures all licenses and subscriptions are canceled preventing ongoing charges?|Ignore subscriptions|Subscription and license termination verification|Continue paying forever|Hope vendor cancels|1|Subscription and license termination verification ensures all recurring costs canceled when assets retired preventing wasteful spending on unused services. Termination checklist: (1) SaaS subscriptions (Office 365, Salesforce, Adobe Creative Cloud - cancel user licenses), (2) Maintenance contracts (hardware/software support agreements with annual renewal - submit cancellation notice per contract terms), (3) Software licenses (perpetual licenses: return to pool for reassignment, subscription licenses: cancel), (4) Cloud resources (AWS/Azure compute instances, storage - terminate avoiding monthly charges), (5) Cellular contracts (mobile device data plans), (6) Security services (EDR licenses, SIEM log volume, vulnerability scanning licenses), (7) Domain registrations (if no longer needed), (8) SSL certificates (if associated system retired). Process: (1) Asset database flags associated subscriptions, (2) Termination workflow (submit cancellation requests 30-60 days before renewal per contract terms), (3) Verify cancellation (obtain confirmation numbers, final invoices with $0 balance), (4) Update financial system (remove from recurring expense forecasts), (5) Monitor (watch for erroneous charges, dispute if necessary). Cost impact: retired server still incurring $500/month maintenance, 100 unused SaaS licenses at $15/month = $18K annual waste. Finance integration: regular reconciliation between IT asset retirements and subscription cancellations identifies discrepancies. Contract review: cancellation policies (some require 90-day notice, early termination penalties), auto-renewal clauses (opt-out required).|4.0|4.2
What asset management integration provides automated alerts when configuration drift from baseline occurs?|No monitoring|Configuration Management and Monitoring Tools integration|Manual checks monthly|Hope for compliance|1|Configuration Management and Monitoring Tools integration continuously monitors asset configurations detecting unauthorized changes and drift from approved baselines. Integration architecture: (1) Configuration baseline stored in CMDB (approved configurations for each asset type), (2) Monitoring agents or agentless scanning (continuous or periodic configuration checks), (3) Comparison engine (detects differences between actual vs baseline), (4) Alert generation (notify security/IT of drift), (5) Automated remediation (optional - automatically revert to baseline). Monitored configurations: (1) OS settings (firewall rules, user accounts, password policies, registry keys), (2) Security applications (antivirus status, definitions currency, EDR running), (3) Installed software (unauthorized applications, prohibited versions), (4) Services (disabled critical services, newly enabled suspicious services), (5) Network settings (DNS servers, open ports, routing tables), (6) Patches (missing security updates). Tools: (1) CIS-CAT (Center for Internet Security Configuration Assessment Tool compares to CIS Benchmarks), (2) Security compliance tools (Nessus, Qualys scan configurations), (3) Configuration management (Ansible, Puppet, Chef enforce desired state), (4) EDR (detects suspicious configuration changes), (5) FIM (File Integrity Monitoring for critical files/registry). Response: investigate changes (authorized via change management or unauthorized), remediate (revert unauthorized changes), update baseline (if authorized change should be new standard). Drift causes: manual changes (admins troubleshooting), malware (persistence via registry modifications), user modifications (disabled UAC, installed unapproved software).|4.0|4.2
Which asset inventory attribute tracks physical location enabling equipment recovery and audit verification?|Purchase date only|Physical location (building, floor, room)|Color preference|Employee hobbies|1|Physical location tracking records where assets physically located enabling equipment recovery, inventory audits, compliance verification, and emergency response. Location granularity: (1) Region/Country (data residency compliance), (2) City/Office (multi-site organizations), (3) Building (campus environments), (4) Floor, (5) Room/Department (server room, accounting department), (6) Rack/Slot (data center equipment), (7) Cubicle/Desk (end-user devices), (8) GPS coordinates (vehicles, mobile equipment). Benefits: (1) Asset recovery (find equipment for maintenance, relocation, retirement), (2) Physical inventory audits (verify assets where recorded), (3) Compliance (prove data processing location for GDPR, Russia data localization), (4) Disaster response (know what assets affected by facility incident), (5) Chargeback (allocate costs to facilities/departments), (6) Capacity planning (available rack space in data centers), (7) Warranty support (provide location to vendor for on-site service). Tracking methods: (1) Manual updates (moves tracked via tickets, updated in asset database), (2) RFID (detect location via readers in doorways, requires RFID tags), (3) GPS (vehicles, high-value portable equipment), (4) Network-based (IP address indicates location for networked devices, WiFi triangulation). Challenges: mobile devices change locations (track assignment vs location), work-from-home endpoints (home address privacy concerns, use city/state only). Audits: physical inventory reconciliation requires location accuracy, discrepancies indicate control weaknesses or theft.|4.0|4.2
