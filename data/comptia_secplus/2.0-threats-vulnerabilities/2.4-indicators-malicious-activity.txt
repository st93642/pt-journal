What type of malware encrypts files and demands payment for decryption?|Trojan|Ransomware|Worm|Spyware|1|Ransomware encrypts victim's files or systems and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) for the decryption key. It's a major threat to organizations and individuals. Trojans disguise as legitimate software, worms self-replicate, and spyware steals information.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

Which malware type appears legitimate but contains hidden malicious functionality?|Virus|Worm|Trojan|Rootkit|2|A Trojan (Trojan horse) disguises itself as legitimate software but contains hidden malicious functionality. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans don't self-replicate. Viruses attach to files, worms spread independently, and rootkits hide other malware.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

What malware can self-replicate and spread across networks without user interaction?|Virus|Trojan|Worm|Logic bomb|2|Worms are self-replicating malware that spread across networks automatically without requiring user interaction or host files. Viruses require host files and user action, Trojans don't self-replicate, and logic bombs wait for triggers.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

Which attack modifies DNS responses to redirect users to malicious websites?|ARP poisoning|DNS poisoning|IP spoofing|MAC flooding|1|DNS poisoning (DNS cache poisoning) modifies DNS responses to redirect users to malicious websites instead of legitimate ones. ARP poisoning targets network layer addressing, IP spoofing falsifies packet sources, and MAC flooding overwhelms switches.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

What attack intercepts and potentially modifies communications between two parties?|Replay attack|Man-in-the-middle (MitM)|DDoS|Spoofing|1|Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks intercept communications between two parties, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop and potentially modify messages. Replay attacks retransmit captured data, DDoS overwhelms systems, and spoofing impersonates entities.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

Which attack floods a target with traffic from multiple sources to make it unavailable?|DoS|DDoS|Botnet|Amplification|1|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks use multiple systems (often botnets) to flood a target with traffic, overwhelming it and making services unavailable. DoS comes from a single source, botnets are the tools used, and amplification is a DDoS technique.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

What type of malware records user keystrokes to steal credentials?|Spyware|Keylogger|Trojan|Rootkit|1|Keyloggers record keystrokes to capture passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. They're a type of spyware specifically focused on keyboard input. Spyware is broader, Trojans disguise themselves, and rootkits hide malware.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

Which malware is designed to hide its presence and other malware from detection?|Virus|Worm|Rootkit|Adware|2|Rootkits are designed to hide their presence and conceal other malware from operating systems and security tools by operating at low system levels (kernel or boot level). Viruses and worms focus on spreading, and adware displays advertisements.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

What attack captures and retransmits authentication credentials or session tokens?|Man-in-the-middle|Replay attack|Session hijacking|Credential stuffing|1|Replay attacks capture valid authentication credentials or session tokens and retransmit them to gain unauthorized access. MitM intercepts live communications, session hijacking takes over active sessions, and credential stuffing uses stolen credentials from breaches.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

Which indicator might suggest a system is compromised?|Regular updates installed|Unusual outbound network traffic|Normal CPU usage|Scheduled backups completing|1|Unusual outbound network traffic, especially to unknown or suspicious destinations, can indicate compromise as malware often communicates with command and control servers or exfiltrates data. Regular updates, normal CPU usage, and successful backups are positive indicators.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

What attack exploits the Address Resolution Protocol to associate an attacker's MAC address with another device's IP?|DNS poisoning|ARP poisoning|IP spoofing|MAC spoofing|1|ARP poisoning (ARP spoofing) exploits the Address Resolution Protocol to associate the attacker's MAC address with another device's IP address, redirecting traffic to the attacker. DNS poisoning targets name resolution, IP spoofing falsifies source IPs, and MAC spoofing changes MAC addresses.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity

Which malware changes its code structure with each iteration to avoid detection?|Static malware|Polymorphic malware|Metamorphic malware|Encrypted malware|1|Polymorphic malware changes its code structure, appearance, or encryption with each iteration while maintaining the same core functionality, making signature-based detection difficult. Static malware doesn't change, metamorphic completely rewrites itself, and encrypted malware may use consistent encryption.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.4 Indicators of Malicious Activity
