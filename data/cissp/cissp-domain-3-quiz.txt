Which security architecture principle ensures that access is checked every time a resource is accessed?|Complete Mediation|Defense in Depth|Least Privilege|Fail Safe|0|Complete mediation requires that every access to every object is validated, preventing bypass of security controls.|cissp|security-architecture
What is the primary purpose of a reference monitor in security architecture?|User authentication|Access control enforcement|Data encryption|Network monitoring|1|A reference monitor enforces access control policies and must be tamper-proof, always invoked, and small enough to be verifiable.|cissp|security-architecture
Which security model provides confidentiality protection through mandatory access controls?|Bell-LaPadula|Biba|Clark-Wilson|Chinese Wall|0|The Bell-LaPadula model enforces confidentiality by preventing subjects from reading higher-classified objects.|cissp|security-architecture
What does the principle of "secure by design" mean in system development?|Adding security after development|Integrating security throughout development|Testing security separately|Using secure tools only|1|Secure by design integrates security considerations into every phase of system development from requirements to deployment.|cissp|security-architecture
Which architectural layer defines organizational security requirements and policies?|Policy Layer|Model Layer|Mechanism Layer|Implementation Layer|0|The policy layer establishes the rules and requirements that security mechanisms must enforce.|cissp|security-architecture
What is the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)?|User applications|Operating system only|Hardware and software for security enforcement|Network infrastructure|2|The TCB includes all hardware, firmware, and software components responsible for enforcing security policies.|cissp|security-architecture
Which security principle requires that systems fail into a secure state during errors?|Fail Open|Fail Closed|Fail Safe|Fail Secure|3|Fail Secure ensures that when systems encounter errors or failures, they default to denying access rather than allowing it.|cissp|security-architecture
What is the primary purpose of defense in depth?|Single point of protection|Multiple security layers|Cost reduction|Performance optimization|1|Defense in depth implements multiple overlapping security controls so that if one fails, others provide protection.|cissp|security-architecture
Which security architecture pattern assumes no component is inherently trustworthy?|Perimeter Security|Defense in Depth|Zero Trust|Secure by Default|2|Zero Trust Architecture assumes breach and requires continuous verification of all access requests.|cissp|security-architecture
What does the Open Design principle state about security?|Design must be secret|Security depends on secrecy of design|Design can be public|Security through obscurity|1|Kerckhoffs's principle states that security should not depend on secrecy of the design but on cryptographic keys.|cissp|security-architecture
Which engineering practice integrates security into the development lifecycle?|Secure Coding|Security Testing|DevSecOps|Code Review|2|DevSecOps integrates security practices throughout the development pipeline, not just at the end.|cissp|security-engineering
What is the primary goal of secure system design?|Performance optimization|Cost reduction|Resistance to attacks|User convenience|2|Secure system design creates systems that are fundamentally resistant to attacks and vulnerabilities.|cissp|security-engineering
Which principle requires that complex operations need multiple independent conditions?|Separation of Privilege|Least Privilege|Need to Know|Defense in Depth|0|Separation of privilege requires multiple conditions to be satisfied, preventing single points of failure.|cissp|security-engineering
What does "psychological acceptability" mean in security design?|Security must be invisible|Users must understand security|Security should be difficult|Users should fear security|0|Psychological acceptability means security mechanisms should not be so burdensome that users bypass them.|cissp|security-engineering
Which secure design pattern validates all input data against expected formats?|Output Encoding|Input Validation|Error Handling|Session Management|1|Input validation ensures that only properly formatted data is accepted, preventing injection attacks.|cissp|security-engineering
What is the purpose of secure defaults in system configuration?|Maximize functionality|Minimize security|Provide secure initial settings|Reduce configuration time|2|Secure defaults ensure systems start in a secure state, requiring explicit changes to reduce security.|cissp|security-engineering
Which engineering approach starts with business requirements and works down to implementation?|Bottom-Up Design|Top-Down Design|Middle-Out Design|Spiral Design|1|Top-down design begins with high-level requirements and progressively refines them to implementation details.|cissp|security-engineering
What does the "economy of mechanism" principle advocate?|Complex security|Simple and small security|Expensive security|Large security systems|1|Economy of mechanism favors security mechanisms that are as simple and small as possible for verification.|cissp|security-engineering
Which security engineering practice involves removing or encoding dangerous characters?|Input Sanitization|Output Encoding|Data Validation|Access Control|0|Input sanitization removes or encodes potentially dangerous characters from input data.|cissp|security-engineering
What is the primary purpose of security architecture frameworks?|Replace security policies|Guide security implementation|Eliminate security controls|Reduce security costs|1|Security architecture frameworks provide structured approaches for designing and implementing security controls.|cissp|security-engineering
