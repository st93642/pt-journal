What is the first step in vulnerability management?|Remediation|Identification and discovery|Reporting|Ignoring vulnerabilities|1|Identification and discovery is the first stepâ€”finding vulnerabilities through scanning, assessments, and threat intelligence before they can be exploited. Remediation comes after identification, reporting follows assessment, and ignoring vulnerabilities is not acceptable.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management

Which scoring system rates vulnerability severity from 0-10?|OWASP Top 10|CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)|NIST|ISO 27001|1|CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) provides standardized vulnerability severity ratings from 0-10, with 10 being most critical. OWASP Top 10 lists common web vulnerabilities, NIST provides frameworks, and ISO 27001 is an information security standard.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management

What database provides standardized names for publicly known vulnerabilities?|OWASP|CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)|SANS|CompTIA|1|CVE provides standardized identifiers (CVE-YYYY-NNNNN) for publicly known vulnerabilities, allowing consistent tracking across tools and organizations. OWASP focuses on web app security, SANS provides training, and CompTIA offers certifications.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management

Which vulnerability scanning approach provides credentials to scan systems more thoroughly?|Unauthenticated scanning|Credentialed scanning|External scanning only|No scanning|1|Credentialed (authenticated) scanning uses valid credentials to log into systems for more thorough vulnerability detection, finding issues invisible to external scans. Unauthenticated scanning is limited, external-only misses internal issues, and no scanning leaves vulnerabilities undiscovered.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management

What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?|Correctly identified vulnerability|Incorrectly flagged vulnerability that doesn't exist|Missed vulnerability|Critical vulnerability|1|False positives occur when scanners incorrectly flag something as a vulnerability when it's not actually vulnerable or exploitable. This wastes time investigating non-issues. Correctly identified is true positive, missed is false negative, and critical describes severity.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management

Which practice involves ethical hackers simulating attacks to find vulnerabilities?|Vulnerability scanning|Penetration testing|Passive monitoring|Social engineering|1|Penetration testing (pen testing) involves ethical hackers actively simulating real attacks to identify vulnerabilities and test defenses. Vulnerability scanning is automated, passive monitoring doesn't probe systems, and social engineering is one attack technique.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management

What should organizations prioritize when remediating vulnerabilities?|Oldest vulnerabilities first|Critical vulnerabilities in critical systems first|Easiest to fix first|Random order|1|Organizations should prioritize critical and high-severity vulnerabilities in critical systems that pose the greatest risk. Age alone doesn't indicate severity, easiest first ignores risk, and random order is ineffective.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management

Which vulnerability management step confirms that remediation was effective?|Identification|Validation and rescanning|Ignoring results|Initial discovery|1|Validation and rescanning confirms that vulnerabilities were properly remediated by rescanning systems to verify fixes worked and vulnerabilities no longer exist. Identification finds issues, ignoring is ineffective, and initial discovery is the first scan.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management

What is a compensating control in vulnerability management?|Permanent fix|Alternative control when primary fix isn't possible|Ignoring the vulnerability|Deleting the system|1|Compensating controls are alternative security measures implemented when primary remediation isn't possible (e.g., legacy systems that can't be patched). They mitigate risk without fixing root cause. Permanent fix is preferred, ignoring is unacceptable, and deletion may be impractical.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management

Which program pays security researchers for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities?|Penetration test|Bug bounty program|Vulnerability scan|Security audit|1|Bug bounty programs reward security researchers who discover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities, incentivizing ethical hacking. Penetration tests are contracted assessments, vulnerability scans are automated, and security audits review compliance.|4.0 Security Operations|4.3 Vulnerability Management
