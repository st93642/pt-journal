What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?|A firewall|A system that monitors network or host activity for malicious actions or policy violations|An antivirus program|A VPN server|1|An IDS monitors network traffic or host activity to detect suspicious patterns, attacks, or policy violations. It generates alerts but typically doesn't block traffic (unlike IPS which actively prevents intrusions).|Evading IDS|IDS Fundamentals
What is the difference between IDS and IPS?|No difference|IDS detects and alerts; IPS detects and actively blocks/prevents attacks|IPS is faster|IDS is more expensive|1|IDS (Intrusion Detection System) passively monitors and alerts on threats. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) actively blocks detected threats in real-time by dropping packets or resetting connections.|Evading IDS|IDS vs IPS
What are the two main types of IDS deployment?|Hardware and software|Host-based (HIDS) and Network-based (NIDS)|Active and passive|Local and remote|1|Host-based IDS (HIDS) monitors individual systems for file changes, log entries, and local activity. Network-based IDS (NIDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious patterns across the network.|Evading IDS|IDS Types
What is Snort?|A password cracker|An open-source network intrusion detection system|A port scanner|A vulnerability scanner|1|Snort is a widely-used open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS) that uses rules to detect various attacks and suspicious traffic patterns.|Evading IDS|IDS Tools
What are Snort rules used for?|Firewall configuration|Defining signatures and patterns to detect specific attacks or suspicious behavior|Password policies|Encryption settings|1|Snort rules define what traffic patterns to look for, including specific protocols, ports, content strings, and behaviors. Rules specify the action (alert, log, drop) and conditions for detection.|Evading IDS|Snort
What is signature-based detection in IDS?|Detecting digital signatures|Matching traffic patterns against known attack signatures/patterns|Encryption detection|Certificate validation|1|Signature-based detection compares network traffic or system activity against a database of known attack patterns (signatures). It's effective for known attacks but can't detect new/unknown threats (zero-days).|Evading IDS|Detection Methods
What is anomaly-based detection in IDS?|Detecting viruses|Identifying deviations from normal/baseline behavior|Password detection|Port scanning only|1|Anomaly-based detection establishes a baseline of normal behavior and alerts on deviations. It can detect unknown attacks but may generate more false positives than signature-based detection.|Evading IDS|Detection Methods
What is packet fragmentation used for in IDS evasion?|Faster transmission|Breaking packets into smaller fragments to evade signature detection|Compression|Encryption|1|Packet fragmentation splits attack payloads across multiple packets, potentially evading IDS signature matching that expects the full payload in a single packet. The fragments reassemble at the destination.|Evading IDS|Evasion Techniques
What nmap option performs fragmentation?|nmap -sF|nmap -f (fragments packets into 8-byte chunks)|nmap -sS|nmap -O|1|The -f flag in nmap fragments packets into small 8-byte chunks (or 16 bytes with -ff). This can evade IDS systems that don't properly reassemble fragments before signature matching.|Evading IDS|Nmap Evasion
What is session splicing in IDS evasion?|Network splitting|Breaking attack commands across multiple packets/sessions to avoid pattern matching|Session hijacking|MITM attack|1|Session splicing divides attack data across multiple packets or sessions with delays, making signature detection harder.

What is decoy scanning in nmap?|Fake port scanning|Generating fake source IPs (-D) to obscure the real attacker among decoys|Honeypot scanning|Reverse scanning|1|nmap -D RND:10 generates 10 random decoy IPs along with the real scan, making it harder for IDS/admins to identify the actual attacker among multiple simultaneous scan sources.|Evading IDS|Nmap Evasion
What is an idle/zombie scan?|Slow scanning|Using a third-party "zombie" host to scan targets, hiding the attacker's IP|Scanning idle hosts|Background scanning|1|Idle scan (nmap -sI) exploits predictable IP ID sequences on idle hosts.
