What type of attack vector uses deceptive emails to trick users into revealing sensitive information?|Vishing|Phishing|Smishing|Whaling|1|Phishing uses deceptive emails to trick recipients into revealing credentials, downloading malware, or clicking malicious links. Vishing uses voice calls, smishing uses SMS/text messages, and whaling specifically targets executives with phishing.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

Which threat vector involves attackers manipulating people rather than exploiting technical vulnerabilities?|Malware|Social engineering|SQL injection|DDoS|1|Social engineering manipulates people into divulging information or performing actions that compromise security. It exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Malware exploits software, SQL injection exploits databases, and DDoS targets availability.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

What is the attack vector when an attacker sends malicious text messages?|Phishing|Vishing|Smishing|Pharming|2|Smishing (SMS phishing) is an attack vector using text messages to deliver malicious links or request sensitive information. Phishing uses email, vishing uses voice calls, and pharming redirects web traffic to fraudulent sites.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

Which threat vector involves leaving infected USB drives in public places for victims to find?|Social engineering|Removable media|Wireless attack|Supply chain attack|1|Removable media attacks involve leaving infected USB drives, CDs, or other portable storage devices for victims to find and connect to their systems out of curiosity. This is a physical attack vector that leverages human curiosity.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

What attack vector exploits unpatched software vulnerabilities?|Zero-day|Social engineering|Vulnerable software|Physical security breach|2|Vulnerable software attacks exploit known, unpatched vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or services. Zero-day exploits target unknown vulnerabilities, social engineering targets people, and physical breaches target facilities.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

Which vector involves compromising a product during its manufacturing or distribution?|Direct attack|Supply chain attack|Insider threat|Wireless attack|1|Supply chain attacks compromise products, software, or hardware during manufacturing, distribution, or update processes. This allows attackers to reach many organizations through a trusted vendor or supplier. Direct attacks target the organization directly, insider threats come from within, and wireless attacks target networks.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

What is an open service port considered in security terms?|A security control|A threat vector|An attack surface|A mitigation technique|2|Open service ports represent an attack surface - potential entry points that could be exploited. They're not threat vectors (methods of attack) themselves, but expand the attack surface by providing more potential targets. They're not security controls or mitigation techniques.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

Which attack uses voice calls to impersonate trusted entities and extract information?|Phishing|Vishing|Smishing|Impersonation|1|Vishing (voice phishing) uses phone calls where attackers impersonate legitimate entities (IT support, banks, government agencies) to manipulate victims into revealing sensitive information or performing actions. Phishing uses email, smishing uses text, and impersonation is a broader technique.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

What type of threat vector targets executives or high-profile individuals specifically?|Spear phishing|Whaling|Phishing|Pharming|1|Whaling is a targeted phishing attack aimed at high-profile individuals like executives, celebrities, or politicians. Spear phishing targets specific individuals or groups but not necessarily executives. Phishing is mass-scale, and pharming redirects web traffic.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

Which threat vector involves exploiting weaknesses in wireless network security?|Wired attack|Wireless attack|Supply chain|Social engineering|1|Wireless attacks exploit vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other wireless protocols. Examples include rogue access points, evil twins, WEP/WPA cracking, and wireless eavesdropping. Wired attacks target physical networks, supply chain targets vendors, and social engineering targets people.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

What security risk is created by using default credentials on systems and devices?|It increases performance|It creates an easily exploitable attack vector|It improves compatibility|It simplifies management|1|Default credentials (default usernames and passwords) are publicly known and documented, making them an easily exploitable attack vector. Attackers can quickly gain unauthorized access to systems that haven't changed default credentials. They don't improve performance, compatibility, or truly simplify management.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors

Which attack vector embeds malicious code in image files?|Malicious macro|Image-based attack|PDF exploit|Script injection|1|Image-based attacks hide malicious code within image files (steganography) or exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries. When the image is viewed or processed, the malicious code executes. Macros are in documents, PDF exploits target PDFs, and script injection targets web applications.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.2 Threat Vectors
