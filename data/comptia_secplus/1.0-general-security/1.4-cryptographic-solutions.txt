What does a digital signature provide?|Confidentiality only|Authentication and non-repudiation|Faster encryption|Anonymous communication|1|Digital signatures provide authentication (proves who sent the message) and non-repudiation (sender cannot deny sending it). They use the sender's private key to sign and public key to verify. They don't provide confidentiality or speed, and they identify rather than anonymize.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

Which PKI component maintains a list of revoked certificates?|Certificate Authority (CA)|Certificate Revocation List (CRL)|Registration Authority (RA)|Root certificate|1|The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date due to compromise or other reasons.

What is key stretching used for in cryptography?|Making keys longer physically|Making weak passwords more resistant to brute-force attacks|Stretching key validity periods|Distributing keys to more users|1|Key stretching applies a cryptographic function repeatedly (often thousands of times) to make weak passwords more resistant to brute-force attacks by significantly increasing the time required to test each password. It doesn't physically lengthen keys, extend validity, or relate to distribution.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

Which cryptographic algorithm is currently recommended for symmetric encryption?|DES|3DES|AES|RC4|2|AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is the current recommended symmetric encryption algorithm. DES and 3DES are deprecated due to security weaknesses, and RC4 is considered insecure.

An organization needs to protect sensitive customer data stored on laptops in case of theft. Which encryption solution ensures that data cannot be accessed if the device is powered off or stolen?|File-level encryption|Full-disk encryption (FDE)|Database encryption|Transport encryption|1|Full-disk encryption (FDE) protects all data stored on a hard drive or SSD by encrypting the entire storage device. When the device is powered off or stolen, the data remains encrypted and inaccessible without the proper decryption key or passphrase. FDE can be enhanced with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chips that securely store encryption keys. Examples include BitLocker (Windows) and FileVault (macOS). This is the best solution for protecting against physical device theft.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
In a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), what is the role of the public key?|Decrypt data and generate digital signatures|Encrypt data and validate digital signatures|Store cryptographic keys securely|Revoke compromised certificates|1|The public key in PKI is designed for widespread dissemination and can be freely shared without compromising security. Its primary roles are: (1) encrypting data - converting plaintext to ciphertext that only the corresponding private key can decrypt, and (2) validating digital signatures - verifying that signatures were created by the holder of the matching private key. Public keys use the P7b format with .cer file extension and serve as digital identity proof.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
A company discovers that private keys for their SSL/TLS certificates were exposed during a security breach. What is the immediate action they should take?|Reissue certificates with new hostnames|Replace with self-signed certificates temporarily|Revoke the certificates and add them to a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)|Replace with wildcard certificates|2|When private keys are compromised, the certificates must be immediately revoked and added to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL). This prevents attackers from using the stolen private keys to impersonate the organization or decrypt intercepted communications. After revocation, new certificates with new key pairs must be generated. Simply reissuing certificates without revocation leaves the organization vulnerable to attacks using the compromised keys. CRL allows clients to verify certificate validity.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which cryptographic tool is a specialized hardware device designed to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys with high levels of trust and integrity?|Trusted Platform Module (TPM)|Hardware Security Module (HSM)|Key Management System (KMS)|Secure Enclave|1|A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a dedicated physical device designed to provide robust security for cryptographic key management and operations. HSMs offer tamper-resistant hardware, secure key generation and storage, cryptographic acceleration, regulatory compliance (FIPS 140-2/3), and protection against physical and logical attacks. They are used in banking, PKI, cloud services, and high-security environments. Key escrow systems often use HSMs to securely store backup copies of cryptographic keys.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
An administrator needs to encrypt individual files so that each file has its own encryption key and can be decrypted independently. Which encryption level should they implement?|Full-disk encryption|Volume encryption|File-level encryption|Record-level encryption|2|File-level encryption encrypts individual files independently, with each file potentially having its own encryption key. This provides granular control over data protection, allowing different files to have different security levels and enabling per-user or per-file access controls. Encrypted File System (EFS) on Windows is an example. File encryption protects data both at rest and in motion when files are copied between systems, and remains encrypted even if the storage device is stolen. This is ideal when different files require different security policies.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which symmetric encryption algorithm, adopted by NIST in 2001, supports key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits and is considered highly secure for modern applications?|Data Encryption Standard (DES)|Triple DES (3DES)|Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|Blowfish|2|Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was selected by NIST in 2001 to replace DES and 3DES. AES is a symmetric block cipher that supports key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits, offering significantly stronger security than its predecessors. AES-256 is particularly strong and widely used in government, financial, and commercial applications. AES is efficient on modern hardware, suitable for encrypting large volumes of data, and resistant to all known practical cryptographic attacks. It's the gold standard for symmetric encryption.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
What cryptographic protocol establishes a secure, encrypted connection between two communicating systems over the internet, commonly used for HTTPS?|Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)|Secure Shell (SSH)|Transport Layer Security (TLS)|Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)|2|Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and establishes encrypted connections between systems. TLS works with TCP/IP and is most commonly seen in HTTPS for secure web browsing. The TLS handshake process includes: negotiating encryption parameters, exchanging cryptographic keys, authenticating identities, and establishing a secure channel. TLS protects data in transit from eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. It uses both asymmetric encryption for key exchange and symmetric encryption for data transfer.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
In asymmetric encryption, what is the primary role of the private key?|Encrypt data and validate signatures|Decrypt data and generate digital signatures|Exchange symmetric keys securely|Revoke certificates|1|The private key in asymmetric encryption must be kept confidential and secure. Its primary roles are: (1) decrypting data - converting ciphertext (encrypted with the corresponding public key) back to readable plaintext, and (2) generating digital signatures - creating cryptographic signatures that prove authenticity and provide non-repudiation. Private keys use the P12 format with .pfx file extension. They are often stored in hardware security modules or protected by strong passwords and biometric authentication. Compromise of a private key undermines all security guarantees.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which key exchange algorithm allows two parties to agree upon a shared secret key even when communicating over an insecure channel?|RSA|Diffie-Hellman|Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)|Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)|1|Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a cryptographic protocol that enables two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel without ever transmitting the key itself. Each party generates a public-private key pair, exchanges public keys, and independently computes the same shared secret. This shared secret can then be used for symmetric encryption. Diffie-Hellman is foundational to many secure communication protocols and demonstrates the power of asymmetric cryptography for secure key establishment.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
What is the purpose of key escrow in a PKI environment?|Generate new public-private key pairs|Store backup copies of cryptographic keys with a trusted third party|Revoke compromised certificates|Validate certificate chains|1|Key escrow involves a trusted third party securely storing backup copies of cryptographic keys. This serves as a safety net if the original key holder loses access to their private key due to forgotten passphrases, hardware failure, employee departure, or death. The trusted third party (often a designated authority) can retrieve the stored key and help regain access to encrypted data. Key escrow systems typically use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for secure storage. This balances security with business continuity and data recovery needs.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
An organization wants to encrypt data that will be processed in the cloud without the cloud provider being able to access the plaintext. Which advanced encryption technique enables computation on encrypted data?|Homomorphic encryption|Quantum encryption|Steganography|Tokenization|0|Homomorphic encryption is a groundbreaking technique that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without decrypting it first. The results of operations on encrypted data, when decrypted, match the results of the same operations performed on the plaintext. This enables secure cloud computing and data analytics where sensitive data remains encrypted throughout processing, protecting it from the service provider and potential breaches. Homomorphic encryption is computationally intensive but offers unprecedented privacy guarantees.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which component of BitLocker volume encryption provides hardware-based security by securely storing encryption keys and verifying boot process integrity?|Hardware Security Module (HSM)|Trusted Platform Module (TPM)|Secure Enclave|Certificate Authority (CA)|1|Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a specialized chip on the motherboard that provides hardware-based security functions. When integrated with BitLocker, the TPM securely stores encryption keys, making them inaccessible to software attacks or physical key extraction. The TPM also measures and validates the boot process (measured boot), ensuring the system hasn't been tampered with. If the boot process is compromised, the TPM won't release the encryption keys. This two-fold security approach (secure key storage + boot integrity) significantly enhances volume encryption protection.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
What is the file format and extension for a public key certificate in PKI?|P12 format with .pfx extension|P7b format with .cer extension|PEM format with .pem extension|DER format with .der extension|1|Public key certificates in PKI use the P7b format (Public-Key Cryptography Standards) with a .cer file extension. The .cer file serves as digital identity proof, similar to a physical certificate like a diploma. It contains the public key and identifying information about the key owner. In contrast, private keys use P12 format with .pfx extension (imagine a certificate inside an envelope with a key outside). Understanding these formats is important for proper certificate management and troubleshooting PKI issues.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which encryption approach uses a single key for both encryption and decryption and is efficient for encrypting large volumes of data?|Asymmetric encryption|Symmetric encryption|Hybrid encryption|Hashing|1|Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for both encrypting and decrypting data. This approach is highly efficient and fast, making it ideal for encrypting large volumes of data. Symmetric algorithms use block ciphers that process fixed-length blocks of data. Examples include DES (56-bit, obsolete), 3DES (168-bit, being phased out), and AES (128/192/256-bit, current standard). The challenge with symmetric encryption is secure key distribution - both parties must possess the same key, which must be exchanged securely (often using asymmetric encryption).|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
A security administrator needs to encrypt individual database records so that each record has its own encryption key. Which encryption level provides this granular protection?|Full-disk encryption|Database encryption|File-level encryption|Record-level encryption|3|Record-level encryption encrypts individual records within databases with distinct encryption keys for each record. This heightens security because even if an attacker gains access to the database, they must decrypt each record individually. Record-level encryption provides: granular access control (different users can access different records), data integrity (even if the overall database is breached, individual records remain protected), compliance support (for regulations requiring field-level encryption), and reduced blast radius (compromise of one key doesn't expose all data).|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which asymmetric encryption algorithm is commonly used for secure key exchange and digital signatures and is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers?|Diffie-Hellman|Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)|RSA|Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)|2|RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission and digital signatures. RSA's security is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. RSA is used for: secure key exchange, digital signatures, SSL/TLS certificates, and email encryption (PGP/GPG). While secure with sufficient key length (2048-4096 bits recommended), RSA is computationally intensive compared to newer algorithms like ECC. RSA remains foundational to modern PKI.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
An organization uses Encrypted File System (EFS) to protect sensitive documents. Where are the encryption keys typically stored?|In the file itself|In a Hardware Security Module (HSM)|In the user's profile|On a remote key server|2|Encrypted File System (EFS) is a Windows feature that provides file-level encryption. EFS encryption keys are stored in the user's profile, specifically in a protected area tied to the user's Windows account credentials. This means: files are automatically decrypted when the authorized user logs in, files remain encrypted for other users or when the drive is accessed externally, and keys are protected by the user's login password. For additional security, EFS can be configured to use certificates stored on smart cards or combined with BitLocker for defense in depth.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
What is the key length of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which is now considered obsolete due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks?|40 bits|56 bits|128 bits|256 bits|1|Data Encryption Standard (DES) uses a 56-bit key length, which was considered secure when DES was adopted in 1977 but is now obsolete. Modern computing power can brute-force a 56-bit key in hours or days, making DES unsuitable for protecting sensitive data. DES was replaced by Triple DES (3DES), which applies DES three times with different keys for effective 168-bit security, but even 3DES is being phased out. Current standards require AES with at least 128-bit keys, with 256-bit keys recommended for high-security applications.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
In the TLS handshake process, which type of encryption is used for the initial key exchange, and which type is used for the subsequent data transmission?|Symmetric for both|Asymmetric for both|Asymmetric for key exchange, symmetric for data transmission|Symmetric for key exchange, asymmetric for data transmission|2|TLS uses a hybrid encryption approach: asymmetric encryption for the initial handshake and key exchange (because it solves the key distribution problem), and symmetric encryption for the actual data transmission (because it's much faster for large volumes of data). During the handshake, the parties use asymmetric cryptography (like RSA or Diffie-Hellman) to securely agree on a shared symmetric session key. This session key is then used with a symmetric algorithm (like AES) to encrypt all subsequent communications, providing both security and performance.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which cryptographic principle states that encryption keys should be periodically updated to maintain security, typically every one to two years?|Key escrow|Key exchange|Key longevity|Key stretching|2|Key longevity refers to the duration over which cryptographic keys remain secure and effective. Cryptographic best practices recommend periodically updating keys (typically every 1-2 years) to: limit the amount of data encrypted with a single key (reducing the value of a compromised key), stay ahead of increasing computational power, comply with regulatory requirements, and limit the window of exposure if a key is compromised. Key rotation policies should balance security needs with operational complexity. High-security environments may rotate keys more frequently.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
An administrator needs to encrypt an entire partition on a multi-boot system while leaving other partitions unencrypted. Which solution provides partition-level encryption with support for multiple operating systems?|BitLocker|FileVault|VeraCrypt|EFS|2|VeraCrypt is a free, open-source disk encryption software that provides partition-level encryption using strong algorithms like AES, Serpent, and Twofish. VeraCrypt can: encrypt entire partitions or create encrypted containers, support multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), create hidden encrypted volumes for plausible deniability, and use cascading encryption (multiple algorithms applied sequentially). VeraCrypt is the successor to TrueCrypt and is widely used for cross-platform encryption needs. It's ideal when you need encrypted partitions on a multi-boot system or removable media.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
What is the primary advantage of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) compared to RSA?|Faster key generation|Smaller key sizes providing equivalent security|Better resistance to quantum attacks|Simpler implementation|1|Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) provides equivalent security to RSA with much smaller key sizes. For example, a 256-bit ECC key provides roughly equivalent security to a 3072-bit RSA key. This results in: faster computations (less processing time for encryption/decryption), lower power consumption (important for mobile devices and IoT), reduced bandwidth requirements (smaller certificates and signatures), and better performance on resource-constrained devices. ECC is increasingly preferred for modern applications, especially mobile and IoT security, where efficiency matters.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which encryption solution uses a symmetric algorithm with a block cipher to encrypt data in fixed-length blocks, adding padding if necessary to fill incomplete blocks?|Stream cipher encryption|Block cipher encryption|Asymmetric encryption|Hashing|1|Block cipher encryption is a symmetric encryption method that processes data in fixed-size blocks (commonly 128 bits for AES). If the plaintext doesn't fill the entire block, padding is added to reach the required size. Block ciphers like AES operate on each block independently using the same key. Modes of operation (like CBC, CTR, GCM) determine how multiple blocks are processed. Block ciphers are: efficient for encrypting large amounts of data, suitable for both encryption at rest and in transit, and provide strong security when properly implemented with secure modes and initialization vectors.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
An organization wants to verify whether an SSL/TLS certificate has been revoked without downloading an entire Certificate Revocation List. Which protocol should they use?|Certificate Signing Request (CSR)|Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)|Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)|Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP)|1|Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) provides real-time certificate validation by querying the Certificate Authority about a specific certificate's revocation status. OCSP offers advantages over Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs): faster validation (no need to download large CRLs), real-time status (immediate revocation information), reduced bandwidth (only query status of needed certificates), and better scalability. OCSP is widely supported by modern browsers and is the preferred method for certificate validation. Some implementations use OCSP stapling to improve privacy and performance.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which type of certificate can secure multiple subdomains under a single domain (e.g., sales.example.com, support.example.com, www.example.com) with a single certificate?|Self-signed certificate|Root certificate|Certificate Revocation List (CRL) certificate|Wildcard certificate|3|A wildcard certificate uses an asterisk (*) in the domain name to cover all subdomains at one level. For example, a wildcard certificate for *.example.com would secure www.example.com, mail.example.com, ftp.example.com, and any other subdomain. Wildcard certificates offer: cost savings (one certificate instead of many), simplified management (fewer certificates to track and renew), and flexibility (add new subdomains without new certificates). However, wildcards only cover one level of subdomains and compromise of the private key affects all subdomains covered by the certificate.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
What is a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in PKI?|A request to revoke a compromised certificate|A request to a CA to sign and issue a new certificate|A list of revoked certificates|A protocol for validating certificate status|1|A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is a formatted text file that contains information about the entity requesting a certificate and its public key. The CSR is submitted to a Certificate Authority (CA) which validates the information and, if approved, signs the certificate and returns it to the requestor. The CSR includes: the applicant's public key, organizational information (name, location, etc.), the domain name(s) to be secured, and contact information. The CSR generation process creates both the public key (in the CSR) and the private key (kept secret by the requestor).|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
An organization requires hardware-based cryptographic key storage that is tamper-resistant and meets FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or higher. Which solution should they implement?|Trusted Platform Module (TPM)|Hardware Security Module (HSM)|Secure Enclave|Software-based Key Management System|1|Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are dedicated hardware devices designed to meet high security standards like FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or Level 4. HSMs provide: tamper-resistant and tamper-evident hardware, secure key generation using true random number generators, cryptographic acceleration for high-volume operations, secure key storage that prevents extraction, physical security mechanisms (zeroization on tamper detection), and audit logging. HSMs are used in banking, payment processing, PKI certificate authorities, and cloud service providers requiring certified security compliance.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which cryptographic concept refers to the computational complexity and number of possible key combinations, where longer keys provide exponentially more security?|Key longevity|Key length|Key exchange|Key escrow|1|Key length refers to the size of the encryption key measured in bits. Longer keys provide exponentially more security because they increase the number of possible key combinations an attacker must try in a brute-force attack. For example: 128-bit key = 2^128 possible combinations (3.4 × 10^38), 256-bit key = 2^256 possible combinations (1.2 × 10^77 - astronomically larger). Current recommendations: symmetric encryption (AES-256), asymmetric encryption (RSA 2048-4096 bits, ECC 256-384 bits). Longer keys require more computational power but provide stronger security as computing capabilities increase.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
What is the primary purpose of using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) with full-disk encryption?|Accelerate encryption performance|Provide secure hardware-based key storage|Enable remote key escrow|Support multiple encryption algorithms|1|The primary purpose of integrating a TPM with full-disk encryption is to provide secure, hardware-based key storage. The TPM securely stores the encryption keys in a tamper-resistant chip on the motherboard, preventing software-based attacks from extracting the keys. Additionally, the TPM provides measured boot functionality, verifying the integrity of the boot process before releasing the keys. If the system is compromised or the drive is removed and connected to another computer, the TPM won't release the keys, rendering the encrypted data inaccessible. This combines encryption with hardware-backed security.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
In asymmetric cryptography, which key is used to encrypt a message that will be sent to another party?|Sender's private key|Sender's public key|Recipient's private key|Recipient's public key|3|In asymmetric encryption for confidentiality, you encrypt data with the recipient's public key. Only the recipient, who possesses the corresponding private key, can decrypt the message. The process: (1) sender obtains recipient's public key, (2) sender encrypts plaintext using recipient's public key, (3) ciphertext is transmitted, (4) recipient decrypts ciphertext using their private key. This ensures that even if the message is intercepted during transmission, only the intended recipient can read it. This solves the key distribution problem inherent in symmetric encryption.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which self-encrypting drive technology stores encryption keys directly on the drive hardware rather than in a TPM chip?|BitLocker|FileVault|Opal drive|VeraCrypt|2|Opal drive is a self-encrypting drive (SED) standard developed by the Trusted Computing Group. Opal drives have built-in hardware encryption where the encryption keys are generated and stored within the drive's controller, not in an external TPM chip. Benefits include: encryption is always on (no performance impact), keys never leave the drive hardware, instant secure erase (cryptographic erase by destroying keys), protection against drive removal/cloning, and independence from operating system. Opal drives are transparent to the OS and provide hardware-accelerated encryption that doesn't impact system performance.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
What is the bit length of the Triple DES (3DES) encryption algorithm?|56 bits|112 bits|168 bits|256 bits|2|Triple DES (3DES) applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm three times with different keys, resulting in an effective key length of 168 bits (though practical security is closer to 112 bits due to meet-in-the-middle attacks). 3DES was developed to overcome the security weaknesses of 56-bit DES by applying the encryption process three times: encrypt with key1, decrypt with key2, encrypt with key3. While more secure than DES, 3DES is now considered legacy and is being phased out in favor of AES, which provides better security and performance.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which encryption solution protects data as it travels across networks, ensuring confidentiality during transmission between two endpoints?|Data at rest encryption|Transport/communication encryption|Database encryption|File encryption|1|Transport/communication encryption (also called encryption in transit) protects data as it travels across networks. This prevents eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data interception during transmission. Common protocols include: TLS/SSL for web traffic (HTTPS), IPsec for VPNs, SSH for secure remote access, and SFTP for secure file transfers. Transport encryption typically uses asymmetric cryptography for the initial handshake and key exchange, then switches to symmetric encryption for the actual data transfer (providing both security and performance). This is distinct from encryption at rest (protecting stored data).|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
An organization's PKI environment needs a mechanism to quickly distribute information about revoked certificates to clients. Which solution provides a list of revoked certificate serial numbers published by the Certificate Authority?|Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)|Certificate Revocation List (CRL)|Certificate Signing Request (CSR)|Certificate pinning|1|A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a signed list of certificate serial numbers that have been revoked by the Certificate Authority before their scheduled expiration date. Clients can download the CRL to check if a certificate is still valid. Certificates are revoked when: private keys are compromised, certificate information changes, the certificate holder is no longer trusted, or the CA was compromised. CRLs are published at regular intervals and can grow large, which is why OCSP (real-time checking of individual certificates) is often preferred for better performance.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which cryptographic concept is demonstrated when a message is encrypted with a sender's private key, allowing recipients to verify the sender's identity by decrypting it with the sender's public key?|Confidentiality|Digital signature|Key exchange|Key escrow|1|Digital signatures provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. The process: (1) sender creates a hash of the message, (2) sender encrypts the hash with their private key (creating the signature), (3) sender transmits the message and signature, (4) recipient decrypts the signature using sender's public key (verifying sender's identity), (5) recipient hashes the received message and compares it to the decrypted hash (verifying integrity). If they match, the message is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. Digital signatures prevent the sender from denying they sent the message (non-repudiation).|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
A security administrator needs to securely generate and manage encryption keys for a large-scale cloud environment. Which solution is specifically designed for centralized key lifecycle management?|Trusted Platform Module (TPM)|Hardware Security Module (HSM)|Key Management System (KMS)|Secure Enclave|2|A Key Management System (KMS) is a centralized solution for managing the entire lifecycle of cryptographic keys. KMS provides: key generation (creating strong cryptographic keys), key distribution (securely delivering keys to authorized systems), key storage (protecting keys at rest), key rotation (periodically updating keys), key revocation (disabling compromised keys), key backup and recovery, access control and auditing, and compliance reporting. Cloud providers like AWS KMS and Azure Key Vault offer KMS services. KMS is essential for enterprise environments with hundreds or thousands of encrypted resources.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
What is the primary security advantage of using a root of trust in a certificate chain?|It enables wildcard certificates|It provides the foundational certificate that validates the entire chain of trust|It speeds up certificate validation|It allows certificate pinning|1|A root of trust (root certificate) is a self-signed certificate at the top of the certificate hierarchy that serves as the anchor for the entire PKI trust model. Root certificates are: embedded in operating systems and browsers, self-signed (signed by their own private key), highly protected (root CA private keys are typically kept offline), and used to sign intermediate CA certificates (which in turn sign end-entity certificates). The entire certificate chain's security depends on trust in the root certificate. If a root CA is compromised, all certificates in that chain are at risk, which is why root CAs implement extreme security measures.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
Which encryption algorithm is considered legacy and should no longer be used for new implementations due to security vulnerabilities?|AES-256|RSA-2048|DES|ECC|2|Data Encryption Standard (DES) is considered legacy and should not be used for new implementations. DES's 56-bit key length is vulnerable to brute-force attacks with modern computing power - it can be cracked in hours or days. NIST officially deprecated DES in 2005. Even Triple DES (3DES), which was the interim replacement, is being phased out (NIST deprecated 3DES for new applications in 2017). Current standards require AES with minimum 128-bit keys. Legacy protocols using DES should be upgraded to AES to meet modern security requirements and compliance standards.|General Security Concepts|Cryptographic Solutions
