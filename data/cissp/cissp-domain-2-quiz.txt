Which security principle ensures that users have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job functions?|Least Privilege|Defense in Depth|Fail Securely|Zero Trust|0|The principle of least privilege limits access rights to the bare minimum required for legitimate purposes, reducing the attack surface.|cissp|asset-security
What is the primary purpose of defense in depth?|Single layer of protection|Multiple overlapping security controls|Cost reduction|User convenience|1|Defense in depth implements multiple layers of security controls so that if one layer fails, others provide protection.|cissp|asset-security
In the Bell-LaPadula model, what does "No Read Up" prevent?|Reading data at a lower classification level|Reading data at a higher classification level|Writing to lower classification levels|Writing to higher classification levels|1|The No Read Up rule prevents subjects from reading objects at higher classification levels than their own clearance.|cissp|asset-security
Which security model focuses on maintaining data integrity through well-formed transactions?|Bell-LaPadula|Biba|Clark-Wilson|Chinese Wall|2|The Clark-Wilson model ensures integrity by requiring all data modifications to go through certified transformation procedures.|cissp|asset-security
What type of encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption?|Asymmetric encryption|Symmetric encryption|Hashing|Digital signatures|1|Symmetric encryption uses a shared secret key for both encryption and decryption operations.|cissp|asset-security
Which cryptographic algorithm is commonly used for digital signatures and key exchange?|AES|RSA|SHA-256|DES|1|RSA is an asymmetric algorithm widely used for digital signatures, key exchange, and encryption.|cissp|asset-security
What is the primary purpose of a cryptographic hash function?|Encryption|Key exchange|Integrity verification|Authentication|2|Hash functions provide integrity verification by creating a fixed-size digest that changes if the input data is modified.|cissp|asset-security
Which physical security control uses biometric characteristics for access control?|Smart card|PIN code|Fingerprint scanner|Security guard|2|Biometric systems like fingerprint scanners use unique physical characteristics to verify identity.|cissp|asset-security
What type of environmental control detects smoke and automatically activates fire suppression?|HVAC system|Temperature sensor|Smoke detector|Water sensor|2|Smoke detectors monitor for combustion byproducts and can trigger automatic fire suppression systems.|cissp|asset-security
Which data classification level typically requires encryption and strict access controls?|Public|Internal|Confidential|Unclassified|2|Confidential data requires encryption at rest and in transit, along with strict access controls and auditing.|cissp|asset-security
What is the primary goal of separation of duties?|Reduce costs|Prevent fraud|Increase efficiency|Simplify processes|1|Separation of duties ensures that no single individual can complete a critical task alone, preventing fraud and errors.|cissp|asset-security
In access control, what does RBAC stand for?|Rule-Based Access Control|Role-Based Access Control|Risk-Based Access Control|Rights-Based Access Control|1|Role-Based Access Control assigns permissions based on user roles within an organization.|cissp|asset-security
Which security principle states that systems should fail in a secure state rather than an insecure one?|Fail Open|Fail Secure|Fail Safe|Fail Fast|1|Fail Secure ensures that when a system fails, it defaults to a secure state that denies access rather than allowing it.|cissp|asset-security
What type of attack exploits weak encryption algorithms or implementation flaws?|Man-in-the-middle|Cryptanalysis|Brute force|DDoS|1|Cryptanalysis involves breaking cryptographic systems through mathematical analysis or implementation weaknesses.|cissp|asset-security
Which physical security measure protects against unauthorized vehicle access?|Perimeter fence|Mantrap|Turnstile|Bollard|3|Bollards are physical barriers designed to prevent vehicles from entering restricted areas.|cissp|asset-security
What is the purpose of data labeling in information security?|Marketing|Classification identification|Cost tracking|Performance monitoring|1|Data labeling identifies the classification level and handling requirements for information assets.|cissp|asset-security
Which security model enforces mandatory access controls based on clearance levels?|Discretionary Access Control|Mandatory Access Control|Role-Based Access Control|Attribute-Based Access Control|1|Mandatory Access Control enforces access based on security labels and clearance levels, not user discretion.|cissp|asset-security
What should be done with cryptographic keys that are no longer needed?|Reuse them|Archive indefinitely|Destroy securely|Share publicly|2|Compromised or expired keys should be securely destroyed to prevent their misuse.|cissp|asset-security
Which environmental factor can damage electronic equipment if not properly controlled?|Temperature|Color|Sound|Light|0|Extreme temperatures can cause electronic components to fail or operate unreliably.|cissp|asset-security
What is the primary purpose of asset inventory in security management?|Cost accounting|Risk assessment|Resource tracking|Compliance reporting|1|Asset inventory enables proper risk assessment by identifying all valuable assets that need protection.|cissp|asset-security
