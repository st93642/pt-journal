Organizations need different security controls for each: insider threat programs for internal actors, perimeter defenses and access control for external threats.|Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|Threat Actors
A threat actor with limited technical skills downloads automated penetration testing tools and runs them against targets without understanding the underlying mechanisms. Which threat actor type is this?|Nation-state actor|Unskilled attacker (script kiddie)|Organized crime|Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)|1|Unskilled attackers (script kiddies) are characterized by: lack of deep technical knowledge or programming skills, use of pre-made automated tools and scripts, limited understanding of how attacks work, reliance on readily available exploits and tutorials, inability to customize or develop attacks, and opportunistic targeting of easy victims. They differ from sophisticated actors (nation-states, APTs, organized crime) who develop custom tools, understand exploit mechanisms, and conduct targeted operations. Despite their limited capabilities, script kiddies can cause damage using: automated vulnerability scanners, DDoS tools, exploit frameworks (Metasploit), password cracking tools, and publicly available malware. They are often motivated by curiosity, desire for recognition, or minor financial gain.|Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|Threat Actors

An organization detects unusual network traffic patterns where data is being transferred to an external server during off-hours. Investigation reveals a competitor is receiving proprietary research data. Which motivation best describes this attack?|War|Philosophical/political beliefs|Data exfiltration for economic espionage|Revenge|2|Data exfiltration for economic espionage specifically targets intellectual property and business secrets for competitive advantage. Unlike financial gain (selling stolen credit cards), this involves: stealing proprietary research and development, obtaining trade secrets and patents, accessing strategic business plans, copying customer databases and pricing models, and gathering competitive intelligence. Economic espionage can be conducted by: corporate competitors engaging in illegal intelligence gathering, nation-states supporting domestic industries, hired contractors or cybercriminals, and insider threats with industry connections. The impact is long-term competitive disadvantage, loss of market position, compromised innovation pipelines, and potential billions in economic damage. This differs from data exfiltration for direct sale—the goal is strategic business advantage rather than immediate monetization.|Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|Threat Actors
