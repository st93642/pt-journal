# PT Journal Tutorial Expansion Plan Based on "Linux For Hackers: Getting Started with Networking, WiFi Hacking, and Python Scripting"

## Overview
This plan outlines how to expand PT Journal's tutorial library by adapting content from the provided book. The book covers essential hacking topics including Linux basics, networking, Wi-Fi attacks, password cracking, Python scripting, reverse shells, and security practices. We'll integrate this content into PT Journal's existing structure of JSON tutorials and quiz files.

## Content Analysis
The book is organized into 6 chapters:
1. Introduction (Linux basics, networking, tshark)
2. Wi-Fi Hacking (adapter testing, DoS, password cracking, evil twin, captive portals)
3. Password Hashing and Cracking (Hashcat, John the Ripper, ZIP cracking, Windows password bypass)
4. Python Scripting (network scanner, FTP cracker, keylogger, wordlist generation, Wi-Fi automation, fake captive portal)
5. Reverse Shells (concepts, Python/Metasploit implementations, detection)
6. Security (GPG encryption, Steghide, Wireshark monitoring, log analysis)

## Expansion Strategy

### 1. New Tutorial Creation
Create the following new JSON tutorial files in `data/tutorials/`:

#### linux_basics_for_hackers.json
- **Title**: Linux Basics for Hackers
- **Content Source**: Chapter 1 (Getting Started with Linux)
- **Steps**:
  - File operations (cd, ls, cp, mv, rm)
  - Permissions (chmod, chown)
  - Wildcards and pipes
  - Networking interfaces (ifconfig, ip, iwconfig)
  - Essential commands for penetration testing

#### networking_fundamentals.json
- **Title**: Networking Fundamentals for Hackers

- **Steps**:
  - IP addresses, MAC addresses, DNS
  - Ports and services
  - Ping and network scanning (nmap basics)
  - Network interfaces management
  - Packet capture with tshark (HTTP sniffing, DNS monitoring)

#### wifi_security_attacks.json
- **Title**: Wi-Fi Security and Attacks
- **Content Source**: Chapter 2
- **Steps**:
  - Testing wireless adapters (monitor mode, packet injection)
  - Deauthentication attacks (DoS)
  - WPA/WPA2 password cracking with Hashcat
  - Evil twin attacks
  - Setting up captive portals
  - Login credential capture

- **Title**: Password Cracking Techniques
- **Content Source**: Chapter 3
- **Steps**:
  - Hashing concepts and algorithms
  - Dictionary attacks with Hashcat
  - Brute force attacks
  - Windows password extraction and cracking (John the Ripper)
  - Linux password cracking
  - ZIP file password cracking

#### python_penetration_testing.json
- **Title**: Python for Penetration Testing
- **Content Source**: Chapter 4
- **Steps**:
  - Network scanner with OS detection
  - FTP password cracker
  - Keylogger implementation
  - Custom wordlist generation
  - Wi-Fi hacking automation
  - Fake captive portal with Flask

#### reverse_shells_guide.json
- **Title**: Reverse Shells: Creation and Detection
- **Content Source**: Chapter 5
- **Steps**:
  - Reverse shell concepts
  - Python reverse shell implementation
  - Metasploit reverse shells
  - Detection methods on Linux

#### file_security_practices.json
- **Title**: File Security: Encryption and Hiding
- **Content Source**: Chapter 6
- **Steps**:
  - GPG file encryption/decryption
  - Steganography with Steghide
  - Wireshark for Wi-Fi attack detection
  - Log monitoring and analysis

### 2. Quiz Expansion
Add new quiz questions to existing domains or create new quiz files:

#### New Quiz Files to Create:
- `data/ai_powered_offensive_security/python-scripting-quiz.txt` (expand existing)
- `data/pentest/wifi-hacking-quiz.txt` (new)
- `data/pentest/password-cracking-quiz.txt` (new)
- `data/ceh/networking-basics-quiz.txt` (expand existing)

#### Quiz Question Format:
Use the existing pipe-delimited format:
```
question|answer_a|answer_b|answer_c|answer_d|correct_index|explanation|domain|subdomain
```

Add 20-30+ questions per new topic based on book content.

### 3. Integration with Existing Structure
- **Domain Mapping**:
  - Wi-Fi content → pentest/wifi-hacking
  - Password cracking → pentest/password-cracking
  - Python scripting → ai_powered_offensive_security/python-scripting
  - Networking → ceh/networking-basics
  - Security practices → comptia_secplus/security-operations

- **Tutorial Dependencies**: Ensure new tutorials reference existing ones where appropriate (e.g., linux_basics_for_hackers as prerequisite)

### 4. Implementation Steps
1. Create JSON tutorial files following existing format
2. Generate quiz questions from book examples
3. Test tutorials in PT Journal application
4. Update tutorials/mod.rs to include new tutorials
5. Validate quiz parsing and integration

### 5. Content Adaptation Notes
- Convert command-line examples to interactive tutorial steps
- Include safety disclaimers for potentially harmful techniques
- Add prerequisites (Kali Linux, wireless adapters, etc.)
- Focus on educational value over destructive capabilities
- Ensure all content aligns with PT Journal's penetration testing education focus

## Estimated Scope
- **New Tutorials**: 7 JSON files
- **New Quiz Questions**: 80-120+ questions across 4 quiz files
- **Development Time**: 2-3 weeks for content creation and testing
- **Priority**: Start with Linux basics and networking, then Wi-Fi and password cracking

## Next Steps
1. Begin with linux_basics_for_hackers.json creation
2. Create corresponding quiz questions
3. Test integration with PT Journal UI
4. Iterate based on user feedback and testing</content>
