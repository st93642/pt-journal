# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation and Prevention Quiz
# Questions covering XSS types, exploitation techniques, filter bypass, and prevention strategies

Which XSS type is stored permanently in the database?|Reflected XSS|Stored XSS|DOM-based XSS|Blind XSS|1|Stored XSS payloads are saved in the database and executed when other users view the content, making it persistent across sessions.|Web Application Security|XSS Types

What is the safest way to insert user input into HTML?|innerHTML assignment|textContent assignment|outerHTML assignment|insertAdjacentHTML|1|textContent only inserts text without interpreting HTML tags, preventing script execution.|Web Application Security|XSS Prevention

Which of these is a DOM-based XSS source?|document.location.hash|Server response headers|Database query results|File system access|0|document.location.hash can contain user-controlled data from the URL fragment, which is a common DOM XSS source.|Web Application Security|DOM XSS

What does CSP stand for in web security?|Cross-Site Protection|Content Security Policy|Client-Side Prevention|Cross-Site Scripting Prevention|1|CSP is an HTTP header that helps prevent XSS and other code injection attacks by restricting resource loading.|Web Application Security|Content Security Policy

Which XSS payload would work in a JavaScript string context?|'; alert('XSS'); //|' OR '1'='1|<script>alert('XSS')</script>|javascript:alert('XSS')|0|In JavaScript strings, breaking out with quotes and semicolons allows code execution.|Web Application Security|XSS Payloads

What is the primary purpose of the HttpOnly cookie flag?|Prevent XSS attacks|Enable HTTPS only|Block CSRF attacks|Encrypt cookie data|0|HttpOnly prevents JavaScript from accessing cookies, protecting against cookie theft via XSS.|Web Application Security|Cookie Security

Which CSP directive controls script execution?|script-src|default-src|style-src|img-src|0|script-src specifies which scripts can be executed, preventing unauthorized script loading.|Web Application Security|CSP Directives

What is blind XSS?|XSS that doesn't show alerts|XSS in hidden form fields|XSS that requires external logging|XSS in commented code|2|Blind XSS payloads are stored but not visible to the attacker, requiring external logging mechanisms to detect.|Web Application Security|Blind XSS

Which encoding bypasses many XSS filters?|HTML entity encoding|URL encoding|Base64 encoding|Hex encoding|1|URL encoding like %3cscript%3e can bypass filters that don't decode URL-encoded input.|Web Application Security|Filter Bypass

What is the most dangerous DOM XSS sink?|textContent|innerHTML|setAttribute|textContent with encoding|1|innerHTML parses and executes HTML/JavaScript, making it the most dangerous DOM XSS sink.|Web Application Security|DOM XSS Sinks

Which HTTP header prevents MIME type sniffing?|X-Frame-Options|X-Content-Type-Options|Content-Security-Policy|Strict-Transport-Security|1|X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff prevents browsers from MIME type sniffing, reducing XSS risk.|Web Application Security|Security Headers

What is self-XSS?|XSS that affects only the attacker|XSS in self-hosted websites|XSS requiring victim to execute payload|XSS in single-user applications|2|Self-XSS requires the victim to execute the payload themselves, making it difficult to exploit remotely.|Web Application Security|Self-XSS

Which CSP mode allows testing without blocking?|report-only|strict-mode|enforce-mode|test-mode|0|Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only sends violation reports without blocking content, allowing safe testing.|Web Application Security|CSP Implementation

What is the OWASP recommended approach for XSS prevention?|Blacklist filtering|Input validation and output encoding|Removing all user input|Using only server-side rendering|1|OWASP recommends defense-in-depth with input validation, output encoding, and CSP.|Web Application Security|XSS Prevention Strategy

Which XSS type executes in the browser without server interaction?|Reflected XSS|Stored XSS|DOM-based XSS|Blind XSS|2|DOM-based XSS occurs entirely in the browser, manipulating the DOM with client-side JavaScript.|Web Application Security|XSS Types

What is a CSP nonce?|A random number used once|A type of encryption key|A CSP violation counter|A script execution timer|0|Nonces are random values added to CSP and script tags to allow specific scripts while blocking others.|Web Application Security|CSP Nonces

Which of these is NOT a valid XSS prevention technique?|Input sanitization|Output encoding|Character blacklisting|Content Security Policy|2|Character blacklisting (whitelisting) is ineffective as it can be bypassed with encoding and variations.|Web Application Security|XSS Prevention

What is the risk of storing JWT tokens in localStorage?|CSRF attacks|Session fixation|XSS attacks|Man-in-the-middle attacks|2|localStorage is accessible to JavaScript, making JWT tokens vulnerable to theft via XSS attacks.|Web Application Security|Token Storage

Which browser feature can help prevent XSS?|XSS Auditor|Popup blocker|Ad blocker|Password manager|0|Chrome's XSS Auditor (now deprecated) and similar features in other browsers attempt to detect and block reflected XSS.|Web Application Security|Browser Protections

What is the safest way to handle user-generated HTML?|Allow all HTML|Strip all HTML|Use HTML sanitization libraries|Convert to plain text|2|HTML sanitization libraries like DOMPurify safely allow safe HTML while removing dangerous elements.|Web Application Security|HTML Sanitization

Which XSS filter bypass uses inline comments?|/**/alert('XSS')/**/|<scr<!-- -->ipt>|alert`XSS`|eval(String.fromCharCode(97,108,101,114,116))|1|HTML comments can break up script tags to bypass simple filters.|Web Application Security|Filter Bypass Techniques

What is the primary limitation of client-side XSS validation?|Can be bypassed with browser dev tools|Only works in modern browsers|Requires JavaScript enabled|Slower than server-side validation|0|Client-side validation can be completely bypassed using browser developer tools.|Web Application Security|Input Validation
