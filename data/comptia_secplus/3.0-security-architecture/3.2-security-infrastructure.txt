Which device filters traffic between networks based on rules and policies?|Router|Firewall|Switch|Hub|1|Firewalls filter network traffic based on configured rules and policies, controlling what traffic is allowed or blocked between networks. Routers direct traffic, switches forward traffic within networks, and hubs broadcast to all ports.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

What type of firewall operates at the application layer and can inspect content?|Packet filter firewall|Stateful firewall|Next-generation firewall (NGFW)|Network firewall|2|Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) operate at the application layer, can perform deep packet inspection, identify applications, and inspect content including for threats. Packet filter firewalls operate at network layer, stateful firewalls track connections, and network firewall is generic.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

Which security device can detect intrusions but doesn't block them?|Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)|Firewall|Intrusion Detection System (IDS)|Web Application Firewall (WAF)|2|IDS (Intrusion Detection System) monitors traffic and detects suspicious activity but only alerts—it doesn't block. IPS both detects and prevents/blocks, firewalls filter based on rules, and WAF protects web applications.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

What security principle states systems should fail in a secure manner?|Fail open|Fail securely|Fail fast|Fail over|1|Fail securely (fail closed/fail safe) means that when a system fails, it defaults to a secure state, typically denying access. Fail open allows access during failures (less secure), fail fast detects failures quickly, and fail over switches to backup systems.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

Which load balancing approach distributes traffic across servers in order?|Round robin|Least connections|IP hash|Weighted|0|Round robin distributes requests sequentially to each server in order. Least connections sends to the server with fewest active connections, IP hash uses source IP to determine server, and weighted assigns different capacities to servers.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

What security control provides centralized authentication for network devices?|LDAP|RADIUS|Firewall|VPN|1|RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for network devices like switches, routers, and wireless access points. LDAP is for directory services, firewalls filter traffic, and VPNs create secure tunnels.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

Which network device can block malicious traffic in real-time?|IDS|IPS|Router|Switch|1|IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) can detect AND actively block malicious traffic in real-time. IDS only detects and alerts, routers forward traffic, and switches operate at layer 2.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

What is the purpose of a VPN concentrator?|Web filtering|Managing multiple VPN connections|Email filtering|Load balancing web servers|1|VPN concentrators manage multiple VPN connections, handling encryption/decryption and tunnel management at scale. Web filtering, email filtering, and load balancing are separate functions.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

Which security device specifically protects web applications from attacks like SQL injection?|Firewall|IDS|WAF (Web Application Firewall)|Router|2|WAF (Web Application Firewall) specifically protects web applications from attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF by analyzing HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Traditional firewalls operate at lower layers, IDS detects but doesn't block, and routers forward traffic.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

What does a proxy server do in a security architecture?|Forwards DNS queries|Acts as intermediary between clients and servers|Encrypts all traffic|Blocks all inbound traffic|1|Proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and destination servers, making requests on behalf of clients. This provides anonymity, content filtering, caching, and access control. They don't necessarily forward DNS, encrypt all traffic, or block all inbound traffic.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

Which principle states that unnecessary services should be disabled?|Least privilege|Defense in depth|Reducing attack surface|Separation of duties|2|Reducing attack surface involves disabling unnecessary services, closing unused ports, and removing unneeded software to minimize potential attack vectors. Least privilege limits access, defense in depth uses layers, and separation of duties divides responsibilities.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure

What type of VPN is commonly used for remote site-to-site connections?|SSL VPN|IPSec VPN|PPTP|L2TP|1|IPSec VPN is commonly used for site-to-site connections between offices or networks, providing secure tunnels at the network layer. SSL VPNs are typically for remote user access, and PPTP/L2TP are older remote access protocols.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.2 Security Infrastructure
What distinguishes a stateful firewall from a stateless (packet-filtering) firewall?|Stateful firewalls track connection state and context|Stateful firewalls operate faster|Stateful firewalls are cheaper|Stateful firewalls use less memory|0|Stateful firewalls maintain a state table tracking active connections, understanding the context and relationship between packets in a session. They can enforce rules based on connection state (NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED, INVALID), providing better security than stateless packet filters that evaluate each packet independently without context. Stateful inspection allows more intelligent security decisions, like permitting return traffic for established outbound connections while blocking unsolicited inbound connections on the same port.|3.0|3.2
What security appliance combines multiple functions like firewall, IPS, antivirus, and web filtering in one device?|Router|Unified Threat Management (UTM)|Switch|Load balancer|1|Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliances integrate multiple security functions into a single device, including firewall, IPS/IDS, antivirus, anti-spam, content filtering, VPN, and web filtering. UTMs simplify management with a single interface and policy engine, reduce hardware sprawl, and are popular in small-to-medium businesses. However, UTMs can become performance bottlenecks since all functions run on shared resources, and represent a single point of failure requiring high availability configuration for critical environments.|3.0|3.2
Which IDS detection method compares traffic against a database of known attack patterns?|Anomaly-based detection|Signature-based detection|Behavior-based detection|Heuristic detection|1|Signature-based detection (also called pattern matching) compares network traffic or system activity against a database of known attack signatures - unique patterns or byte sequences associated with specific threats. This method provides high accuracy with low false positives for known attacks, but cannot detect zero-day exploits or novel attack variations not in the signature database. Signature databases require regular updates, similar to antivirus definitions. Examples include Snort rules and Suricata signatures.|3.0|3.2
What IDS deployment model monitors traffic at network segments rather than on individual hosts?|HIDS (Host-based IDS)|NIDS (Network-based IDS)|WIDS (Wireless IDS)|AIDS (Application-based IDS)|1|Network-based IDS (NIDS) monitors network traffic at strategic points like network perimeters, DMZ boundaries, or critical subnets using sensors or span ports. NIDS analyzes packets in transit without requiring agent installation on endpoints, providing visibility across multiple systems simultaneously. However, NIDS cannot inspect encrypted traffic without SSL/TLS decryption, may miss attacks on individual hosts, and can be overwhelmed by high-speed networks. NIDS complements HIDS which monitors individual system logs and file integrity.|3.0|3.2
What protocol does Network Access Control (NAC) commonly use for port-based authentication?|RADIUS|802.1X|TACACS+|LDAP|1|802.1X is an IEEE standard for port-based network access control that provides authentication at the data link layer (Layer 2). The 802.1X framework uses three components: supplicant (client device), authenticator (switch/access point), and authentication server (RADIUS). Devices must authenticate before gaining network access - unauthenticated devices are placed on restricted VLANs or denied access. 802.1X is used for both wired Ethernet ports and wireless networks, preventing unauthorized devices from connecting even if physically plugged in.|3.0|3.2
What type of proxy server retrieves resources from servers on behalf of clients, often for caching and content filtering?|Reverse proxy|Forward proxy|Transparent proxy|Open proxy|1|Forward proxies act as intermediaries for clients making requests to external servers, commonly used for content filtering, bandwidth control, caching, and anonymity. Clients configure their browsers to use the forward proxy, which fetches resources, potentially caches them, applies filtering policies, and logs activity. Forward proxies hide client IP addresses from destination servers, enable acceptable use policy enforcement, reduce bandwidth through caching, and provide centralized logging. Examples include Squid and Blue Coat proxy servers.|3.0|3.2
What type of proxy server sits in front of web servers to provide load balancing, SSL termination, and caching?|Forward proxy|Reverse proxy|SOCKS proxy|Transparent proxy|1|Reverse proxies sit in front of one or more backend servers, accepting client requests and forwarding them to appropriate backend servers. Clients believe they're communicating directly with the origin server, unaware of the reverse proxy. Benefits include load balancing across multiple servers, SSL/TLS termination offloading crypto operations from backends, caching static content, compression, DDoS protection, and hiding backend topology from attackers. Examples include NGINX, HAProxy, and AWS Application Load Balancer.|3.0|3.2
What load balancing algorithm directs requests to the server with the fastest response time?|Round robin|Least connections|Least response time|IP hash|2|Least response time (also called least latency) load balancing selects the server with the fastest response time and fewest active connections, optimizing user experience by routing to the most responsive backend. This dynamic algorithm adapts to server performance variations, sending more traffic to faster servers and less to slower ones. This is ideal for geographically distributed servers or heterogeneous server pools with varying capabilities. However, it requires active health monitoring and response time tracking, adding overhead compared to static algorithms like round robin.|3.0|3.2
What VPN protocol operates at Layer 2 and can tunnel multiple protocols?|IPSec|SSL/TLS|L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)|OpenVPN|2|L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) operates at the data link layer and can tunnel multiple network protocols (not just IP), making it protocol-agnostic. L2TP is often combined with IPSec (L2TP/IPSec) for encryption since L2TP itself doesn't provide encryption. L2TP creates virtual circuits for point-to-point connections and is commonly used for site-to-site VPNs and remote access. However, L2TP/IPSec can be blocked by firewalls due to requiring multiple ports and protocols (UDP 500, 4500, ESP protocol 50).|3.0|3.2
Which AAA protocol uses TCP and separates authentication, authorization, and accounting functions more granularly than RADIUS?|Kerberos|TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)|LDAP|SAML|1|TACACS+ uses TCP port 49, providing more granular control over AAA functions compared to RADIUS which uses UDP. TACACS+ encrypts the entire packet payload (RADIUS only encrypts passwords), supports detailed command authorization for network devices, and separates authentication, authorization, and accounting into distinct processes. TACACS+ is predominantly used for network device administration (routers, switches, firewalls), while RADIUS is more common for network access control. TACACS+ is Cisco proprietary, though widely supported.|3.0|3.2
What NAC capability checks device security posture before granting network access?|Port mirroring|Posture assessment (health checking)|MAC filtering|VLAN tagging|1|NAC posture assessment (also called health checking) evaluates device security compliance before granting network access. Checks include: OS patch level, antivirus status and definition currency, firewall status, required software installation, and configuration compliance. Non-compliant devices may be denied access, placed in quarantine VLANs for remediation, or granted restricted access. Posture assessment can use persistent agents installed on devices or agentless methods using AD queries, WMI, or dissolvable Java/ActiveX agents. Examples include Cisco ISE NAC profiling and Aruba ClearPass posture modules.|3.0|3.2
What next-generation firewall capability identifies applications regardless of port or protocol used?|Port-based filtering|Application awareness and control|MAC address filtering|VLAN tagging|1|Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) provide application awareness through deep packet inspection, identifying applications based on traffic signatures and behavioral characteristics rather than just port numbers. This prevents application tunnel evasion where applications like Skype or BitTorrent use non-standard ports or HTTP/HTTPS tunneling to bypass traditional port-based firewalls. NGFWs can create policies like "allow Salesforce but block Facebook" or "allow Dropbox for IT department only," providing granular control. Palo Alto Networks pioneered App-ID technology for application identification.|3.0|3.2
What IPS placement inline with traffic is called, and what's the primary risk?|Out-of-band; no risk|Inline mode; becoming a single point of failure|Passive mode; false positives|Monitor mode; high latency|1|Inline IPS deployment places the IPS directly in the traffic path where it can actively block threats, but creates a single point of failure - if the IPS hardware fails or software crashes, it can disrupt network connectivity. Inline IPS devices should have hardware bypass capabilities that automatically forward traffic if the IPS fails, preventing complete network outage. High availability (HA) IPS pairs are recommended for critical links. In contrast, passive IPS monitors span/mirror ports and can only alert, not block, but cannot cause network outages.|3.0|3.2
What Web Application Firewall deployment protects against injection attacks and XSS?|Network firewall|WAF with OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set|Host-based firewall|Packet filtering firewall|1|Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) specifically protect web applications from attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), file inclusion, and other OWASP Top 10 threats by analyzing HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses. ModSecurity with the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) provides comprehensive rulesets for detecting common attack patterns in parameters, headers, and payloads. WAFs operate at Layer 7, understanding application context that network firewalls cannot, and can be deployed as hardware appliances, virtual appliances, or cloud services (AWS WAF, Cloudflare WAF, Imperva).|3.0|3.2
What SSL/TLS inspection technique allows middlebox devices to decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt traffic?|SSL stripping|SSL pinning|SSL/TLS interception (man-in-the-middle inspection)|SSL tunneling|2|SSL/TLS interception (also called SSL/TLS decryption or man-in-the-middle inspection) allows security devices like NGFWs, proxy servers, and DLP systems to decrypt HTTPS traffic for inspection, then re-encrypt it before forwarding. The device presents a certificate from an enterprise CA trusted by clients, establishing two separate TLS sessions - one to client, one to server. This enables threat detection and DLP in encrypted traffic, which now comprises over 90% of web traffic. However, it breaks certificate pinning, introduces privacy concerns, and can violate compliance regulations like HIPAA for healthcare traffic.|3.0|3.2
What type of firewall filtering examines packet headers without considering connection context?|Stateful packet inspection|Stateless packet filtering|Deep packet inspection|Application layer gateway|1|Stateless packet filtering examines each packet independently based only on header information like source/destination IP, source/destination port, and protocol, without tracking connection state. Early routers and first-generation firewalls used stateless Access Control Lists (ACLs). Stateless filtering is fast and consumes minimal memory but cannot distinguish between legitimate return traffic and spoofed packets, requires opening high-numbered ports for return traffic, and is vulnerable to session hijacking. Stateless filtering is still used for basic perimeter protection and on high-speed routers where performance is critical.|3.0|3.2
What IDS detection technique establishes baseline normal behavior then alerts on deviations?|Signature-based detection|Anomaly-based detection (behavioral analysis)|Heuristic detection|Reputation-based detection|1|Anomaly-based detection (also called behavioral analysis or heuristic analysis) establishes a baseline of normal network traffic patterns, user behavior, or system activity during a learning period, then alerts on statistical deviations from that baseline. This can detect zero-day attacks and novel attack methods that signature-based systems miss. However, anomaly detection generates more false positives, requires careful tuning, and can miss attacks that mimic normal behavior. Initial baseline establishment requires clean traffic without existing compromises. Advanced systems use machine learning to continuously adapt baselines.|3.0|3.2
What firewall technology rewrites private IP addresses to public addresses for Internet communication?|VLAN|NAT (Network Address Translation)|Proxy|VPN|1|Network Address Translation (NAT) rewrites source/destination IP addresses in packet headers as they traverse the firewall, allowing multiple private IP addresses to share one or few public IPs. PAT (Port Address Translation), also called NAT overload, extends this by also mapping different source ports. NAT conserves IPv4 addresses, hides internal network topology, and provides basic security through obscurity. However, NAT breaks end-to-end connectivity, complicates protocols carrying IP addresses in payloads (SIP, FTP), and requires port forwarding rules for inbound connections to internal servers.|3.0|3.2
What protocol provides encrypted remote access VPN connections over HTTPS (port 443)?|IPSec|L2TP|SSL VPN (TLS VPN)|PPTP|2|SSL VPNs (more accurately TLS VPNs) use standard HTTPS (TCP 443) to provide remote access VPN connectivity through web browsers or lightweight clients, making them easier to deploy and harder to block than IPSec VPNs requiring multiple ports. SSL VPNs can provide clientless access via web portals, port forwarding for specific applications, or full tunnel network access. They're ideal for BYOD scenarios, contractor access, and restrictive firewall environments. However, SSL VPNs have higher overhead than IPSec, can have client compatibility issues, and the 2014 Heartbleed vulnerability demonstrated risks of TLS implementation bugs.|3.0|3.2
What load balancer feature removes failed servers from the pool automatically?|Round robin|Health checks (probes)|Connection draining|Session persistence|1|Load balancer health checks (also called probes or monitors) continuously test backend servers to detect failures, automatically removing unhealthy servers from the load balancing pool and restoring them when healthy. Health checks can be active (synthetic transactions) or passive (monitoring real traffic). Methods include: TCP port checks, HTTP GET requests expecting specific status codes, SSL handshake validation, and application-level checks querying databases. Health check intervals, timeout values, and failure thresholds must be tuned - too aggressive causes false positives, too lenient delays failure detection. This ensures high availability by routing traffic only to working servers.|3.0|3.2
What NAC enforcement method restricts non-compliant devices to a limited network for remediation?|Port shutdown|VLAN quarantine|MAC blacklisting|Certificate revocation|1|NAC quarantine VLANs (also called remediation VLANs) isolate non-compliant devices in a restricted network segment with limited access - typically only to patch servers, antivirus updates, and remediation portals. This allows automatic remediation of deficiencies like missing patches or outdated antivirus before granting full network access. Once devices become compliant, they're automatically moved to production VLANs. Quarantine prevents security risks from non-compliant devices while enabling self-service remediation, reducing helpdesk burden. Alternative enforcement includes port blocking (more disruptive) or access restrictions via firewall rules (harder to implement).|3.0|3.2
What firewall generation added intrusion prevention, application awareness, and user identity integration?|First-generation packet filters|Second-generation stateful firewalls|Third-generation application layer gateways|Next-generation firewalls (NGFW)|3|Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) integrate traditional firewall, IPS, application control, user/group awareness, SSL inspection, and threat intelligence into unified platforms. Unlike traditional firewalls operating at network/transport layers (L3/L4), NGFWs provide deep packet inspection at application layer (L7), identifying applications regardless of port/protocol and creating granular policies based on application functions, users, and content. NGFW capabilities include: application visibility and control, integrated IPS, URL filtering, antivirus, sandboxing, SSL decryption, and user/group-based policies integrated with Active Directory. Leading vendors include Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and Check Point.|3.0|3.2
What type of proxy transparently intercepts traffic without client configuration?|Explicit proxy|Transparent proxy (intercepting proxy)|Reverse proxy|Anonymous proxy|1|Transparent proxies (also called intercepting proxies) intercept traffic at the network layer without requiring client configuration, typically using firewall rules to redirect HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the proxy. Clients are unaware they're using a proxy, requiring no browser configuration changes. Transparent proxies enable organization-wide policy enforcement without desktop configuration, supporting BYOD devices. However, they complicate SSL/TLS interception requiring certificate trust issues, can break applications expecting direct connections, and may violate user privacy expectations. Transparent proxies are common in schools, guest networks, and ISP content filtering.|3.0|3.2
What VPN configuration connects two sites permanently with always-on encrypted tunnels?|Remote access VPN|Site-to-site VPN (gateway-to-gateway)|SSL VPN|Clientless VPN|1|Site-to-site VPNs (also called gateway-to-gateway or LAN-to-LAN VPNs) create permanent encrypted tunnels between two or more networks, typically connecting branch offices to headquarters or linking datacenters. VPN gateways at each site handle encryption/decryption transparently for all users - no client software required. IPSec is the standard protocol for site-to-site VPNs. Benefits include extending private networks securely over public Internet, eliminating expensive MPLS circuits, and enabling any-to-any connectivity in hub-and-spoke or full-mesh topologies. Site-to-site VPNs should use high availability pairs to prevent single points of failure.|3.0|3.2
What firewall architecture uses multiple firewalls to create isolated network zones?|Single firewall|Screened subnet (dual firewall DMZ)|Router ACLs|Transparent firewall|1|Screened subnet architecture (traditionally called dual-homed firewall DMZ) uses two firewalls creating three zones: external (Internet), DMZ (public-facing servers), and internal (private network). External firewall permits only necessary services to DMZ servers, internal firewall restricts DMZ-to-internal communications. This provides defense in depth - compromising a DMZ web server doesn't grant internal network access. Modern implementations use three-interface single firewalls with separate security zones, or advanced configurations with multiple DMZ segments for different risk levels. The architecture ensures that even if perimeter defenses fail, internal assets remain protected.|3.0|3.2
What IPS technique delays suspicious traffic temporarily while analyzing behavior to detect threats?|Blacklisting|Whitelisting|Sandboxing and detonation|Signature matching|2|IPS sandboxing (also called file detonation or dynamic analysis) quarantines suspicious files or executables in isolated virtual environments, executing them to observe behavior before allowing delivery to endpoints. This detects zero-day malware and sophisticated threats that evade signature detection. If malicious behavior is observed (registry modifications, network connections to C2 servers, file encryption), the file is blocked and signatures are generated. Advanced sandboxes use anti-evasion techniques since malware may detect virtualization and remain dormant. Cloud sandboxing services like Palo Alto WildFire and FireEye AX series provide crowd-sourced threat intelligence from detonation analysis.|3.0|3.2
What RADIUS packet type is sent by the server to request additional authentication information?|Access-Accept|Access-Reject|Access-Challenge|Access-Request|2|RADIUS Access-Challenge packets are sent by the RADIUS server to request additional authentication information from the supplicant, enabling multi-factor authentication or challenge-response protocols. For example, after initial password authentication, Access-Challenge can request an OTP from a token. The supplicant responds with an Access-Request containing the additional credentials. This continues until authentication succeeds (Access-Accept), fails (Access-Reject), or times out. Access-Challenge enables: token-based MFA, password change prompts, terms of use acceptance, and gradual authentication strengthening based on risk. EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) methods leverage Access-Challenge for complex authentication flows.|3.0|3.2
What load balancing feature maintains client requests to the same backend server for session continuity?|Health probes|Session persistence (sticky sessions)|Connection pooling|Round robin|1|Session persistence (also called sticky sessions or session affinity) ensures all requests from a specific client are routed to the same backend server for the session duration, maintaining application state stored in server memory. Persistence methods include: source IP affinity (simplest but fails with NAT), HTTP cookie insertion (load balancer inserts tracking cookie), SSL session ID persistence, and application cookies. Session persistence is required for applications that don't externalize session state to shared databases or caches. However, it reduces load distribution efficiency and can cause problems if the persistent server fails - requiring session replication or external session storage for high availability.|3.0|3.2
What security capability allows NGFWs to create policies based on Active Directory users and groups?|MAC-based filtering|User-ID (identity-based firewalling)|IP-based filtering|Port-based filtering|1|User-ID or identity-based firewalling integrates NGFWs with directory services (Active Directory, LDAP) to map IP addresses to usernames, enabling policies like "allow finance_group to access accounting_app" instead of IP-based rules. This works through domain controller log monitoring, WMI queries, terminal services agents, or captive portal authentication. User-ID provides: policy portability as users move between IPs/devices, granular application access by user/group, detailed logging for compliance, and support for BYOD where IPs are dynamic. This shifts security policy from network-centric (where) to user-centric (who), essential for modern dynamic environments and zero trust architectures.|3.0|3.2
What IPS evasion technique fragments or segments attack payloads to avoid signature detection?|IP spoofing|Fragmentation and segmentation evasion|Encryption|Port hopping|1|Fragmentation and segmentation evasion splits attack payloads across multiple packets, hoping the IPS cannot reassemble and inspect the complete attack signature. Techniques include: IP fragmentation (splitting at network layer), TCP segmentation (small TCP segments), overlapping fragments with conflicting data, and out-of-order packet delivery. Modern IPS systems counter this through stateful stream reassembly that reconstructs application-layer data before signature matching. However, reassembly consumes memory and CPU - attackers can DoS the IPS through fragmentation floods. IPS devices must balance evasion protection against performance impact and carefully match target OS reassembly behavior to avoid evasion.|3.0|3.2
What NAC feature automatically discovers and classifies devices connecting to the network?|Port security|Device profiling and fingerprinting|VLAN assignment|Certificate validation|1|NAC device profiling automatically discovers, classifies, and inventories network-connected devices without requiring agents, using passive techniques: DHCP fingerprinting (option 55, vendor class), HTTP user-agent strings, MAC address OUI lookups, NetBIOS/LLMNR/mDNS queries, examining certificate requests, SNMP queries, and behavioral analysis. Profiling classifies devices as: Windows PC, iPhone, IP camera, medical device, etc., enabling automatic policy assignment. IoT devices lacking agent support particularly benefit from profiling. Cisco ISE, Aruba ClearPass, and ForeScout use extensive device libraries. Profiling enables visibility into shadow IT and unknown devices, and supports BYOD by differentiating personal vs corporate-managed devices.|3.0|3.2
What proxy architecture scales horizontally by distributing load across multiple proxy servers?|Single proxy|Proxy chaining|Proxy cluster (proxy array)|Parent-child proxy|2|Proxy clustering (also called proxy arrays or distributed proxy architectures) deploys multiple proxy servers sharing load and providing high availability. Technologies include: CARP (Cache Array Routing Protocol), WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol), and DNS round-robin. Clustered proxies share cached content through ICP (Internet Cache Protocol) or digest exchanges, maximizing cache hit rates. Benefits include horizontal scalability, redundancy (failure of one proxy doesn't affect others), and geographic distribution. However, cluster coordination introduces overhead and session persistence challenges. Modern implementations use load balancers in front of proxy clusters for transparent failover and even distribution.|3.0|3.2
What firewall inspection technique examines packet payload content beyond headers?|Shallow packet inspection|Deep packet inspection (DPI)|Stateless filtering|Port mirroring|1|Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) analyzes packet payload content beyond headers, examining application-layer data to identify protocols, applications, and threats. DPI enables: application identification regardless of port (finding BitTorrent on port 80), detecting evasion techniques, identifying sensitive data for DLP, reconstructing files from packet streams for malware analysis, and detecting sophisticated attacks hiding in application protocols. NGFWs, IPS, and DLP systems use DPI. However, DPI cannot inspect end-to-end encrypted traffic without SSL interception, raises privacy concerns since all content is analyzed, requires substantial processing power limiting throughput, and may be blocked by VPNs or Tor.|3.0|3.2
What VPN split tunneling configuration routes some traffic through the VPN and some directly to the Internet?|Full tunnel|Split tunnel|Forced tunnel|Bypass tunnel|1|Split tunneling allows VPN clients to simultaneously access resources through the encrypted VPN tunnel (corporate network) and directly to the Internet, routing based on destination IP ranges or domains. This reduces VPN gateway load and bandwidth consumption, improves performance for Internet services like streaming, and enables access to local network resources (printers). However, split tunneling introduces security risks: malware from untrusted Internet sites can compromise the VPN-connected device and potentially pivot into the corporate network. Many organizations disable split tunneling to enforce all traffic through corporate security controls, though this became challenging during COVID-19 remote work when VPN gateways became bottlenecks.|3.0|3.2
What technology allows multiple VPN tunnels to be established simultaneously on different ports for redundancy?|VPN bonding|Multipath VPN|VPN failover|Active-active VPN|1|Multipath VPN (also called VPN bonding or link aggregation) establishes multiple simultaneous VPN tunnels across different Internet connections (cable, DSL, 4G LTE), combining bandwidth and providing automatic failover. Technologies include: SD-WAN with integrated VPN, DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN), WireGuard with multiple endpoints, and proprietary solutions like Speedify. Multipath VPN provides: increased aggregate bandwidth by load balancing across connections, automatic failover with no dropped sessions, reduced latency through path selection, and cost-effective bandwidth scaling using commodity Internet. However, multipath requires compatible endpoints, introduces configuration complexity, and may have issues with connection-tracking devices like some firewalls.|3.0|3.2
What RADIUS attribute specifies the VLAN to assign an authenticated user?|Tunnel-Type|Tunnel-Private-Group-ID|Filter-ID|Framed-IP-Address|1|RADIUS Tunnel-Private-Group-ID attribute (attribute 81) specifies the VLAN ID to assign to an authenticated user or device during 802.1X authentication, enabling dynamic VLAN assignment based on user credentials, group membership, or device posture. This allows implementing role-based network segmentation where employees, guests, contractors, and IoT devices are automatically placed in appropriate VLANs without manual switch configuration. For example, finance employees automatically get VLAN 10 with access to financial systems, while guests get VLAN 99 with Internet-only access. Dynamic VLAN assignment is fundamental to NAC solutions, zero trust architectures, and secure BYOD implementations.|3.0|3.2
What IPS technique blocks traffic from IP addresses with poor reputation scores?|Signature detection|Reputation-based filtering|Anomaly detection|Heuristic analysis|1|Reputation-based filtering blocks or restricts traffic from IP addresses, domains, or URLs with poor reputation scores based on crowd-sourced threat intelligence. Reputation databases track: known botnet C2 servers, spam sources, malware distribution sites, phishing domains, and IPs with history of malicious activity. This provides early detection of threats before signatures exist and reduces alert volume by blocking known-bad sources. However, reputation filtering can block legitimate traffic if IPs are shared (NAT, cloud services), requires continuous threat intelligence updates, and sophisticated attackers use newly registered domains (zero-day domains) or compromised legitimate sites to evade reputation filters. Vendors include Cisco Talos, Symantec, and Proofpoint.|3.0|3.2
What firewall capability allows traffic to flow directly between branch offices instead of routing through headquarters?|Hub-and-spoke|Direct access VPN mesh topology|Hairpinning|Backhaul|1|Direct access or VPN mesh topology allows branch offices to establish direct encrypted tunnels to each other, rather than routing all traffic through a central headquarters (hub-and-spoke). This eliminates hairpinning (wasteful routing through HQ), reduces latency for branch-to-branch communication, and prevents HQ from becoming a bottleneck. Technologies enabling mesh include: DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN), SD-WAN with dynamic path selection, FlexVPN, and GETVPN. Full mesh becomes complex with many sites (n×(n-1)/2 tunnels), so partial mesh connecting only frequently communicating sites is common. Cloud-based SD-WAN simplifies mesh management through centralized orchestration.|3.0|3.2
What load balancer algorithm hashes source IP and destination IP to determine which backend server handles the connection?|Round robin|Least connections|IP hash (source IP affinity)|Weighted round robin|2|IP hash load balancing applies a hash function to the source IP address (and sometimes destination IP/port) to consistently route connections from the same client to the same backend server. This provides session persistence without requiring cookies or application-layer inspection, working for non-HTTP protocols. IP hash distributes load somewhat evenly (assuming diverse client IP distribution) while maintaining consistency for caching benefits. However, IP hash fails with proxies or NAT where many clients share one IP, doesn't adapt to server load differences, and clients behind NAT all hit the same server. It's useful for UDP-based services, caching servers, and scenarios where cookie insertion isn't possible.|3.0|3.2
