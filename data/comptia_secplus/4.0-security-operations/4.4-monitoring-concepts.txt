What does SIEM stand for in security monitoring?|Security Information and Event Management|System Integration and Event Monitoring|Software Installation and Execution Manager|Secure Internet Email Management|0|SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) aggregates and analyzes security logs and events from multiple sources to detect threats and support incident response. The other options are not actual security technologies.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts

Which monitoring tool specifically focuses on endpoint detection and response?|SIEM|EDR|Firewall|Router|1|EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) specifically monitors endpoints (workstations, servers, mobile devices) for suspicious activity, providing detection, investigation, and response capabilities. SIEM aggregates logs broadly, firewalls filter network traffic, and routers direct traffic.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts

What is the primary purpose of log aggregation?|Delete all logs|Centralize logs from multiple sources for analysis|Encrypt all logs|Slow down logging|1|Log aggregation centralizes logs from multiple sources into a single location for easier analysis, correlation, and long-term storage. Deleting logs loses evidence, encryption protects logs but isn't aggregation's purpose, and slowing logging degrades monitoring.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts

Which protocol is commonly used for collecting and sending log data?|HTTP|Syslog|FTP|SMTP|1|Syslog is the standard protocol for collecting and transmitting log messages from network devices, servers, and applications to centralized logging servers. HTTP is for web browsing, FTP for file transfer, and SMTP for email.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts

What does SNMP stand for in network monitoring?|Simple Network Management Protocol|Secure Network Monitoring Program|System Network Message Protocol|Standard Network Mail Protocol|0|SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) monitors and manages network devices, collecting information about their status, performance, and configuration. The other options are not actual network protocols.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts

Which monitoring approach analyzes traffic flows rather than packet contents?|Deep packet inspection|NetFlow/IPFIX|Port scanning|Vulnerability scanning|1|NetFlow and IPFIX analyze traffic flows (source, destination, ports, protocols, volumes) rather than packet contents, providing network visibility for security monitoring and performance analysis. Deep packet inspection examines contents, port scanning finds open ports, and vulnerability scanning finds weaknesses.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts

What is a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform used for?|Manual security tasks only|Automating incident response workflows|Slowing down responses|Eliminating human analysts|1|SOAR platforms automate security workflows and incident response processes, integrating tools and orchestrating responses to reduce manual effort and response times. They don't eliminate human analysis but augment it.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts

Which monitoring technique establishes normal behavior to detect anomalies?|Signature-based detection|Behavioral analytics|Static analysis|Port scanning|1|Behavioral analytics (UEBA - User and Entity Behavior Analytics) establishes baseline normal behavior and detects anomalies that may indicate compromise. Signature-based detection matches known patterns, static analysis examines code, and port scanning finds open ports.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts

What is the purpose of a security baseline in monitoring?|Maximum security level|Normal/expected state to compare against|Minimum security with no monitoring|Random security configuration|1|Security baselines establish the normal/expected state of systems and networks, providing a reference point to detect deviations that may indicate security issues. Maximum security may be impractical, minimum with no monitoring is ineffective, and random configurations prevent effective comparison.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts

Which tool monitors file integrity to detect unauthorized changes?|Antivirus|FIM (File Integrity Monitoring)|Firewall|Router|1|FIM (File Integrity Monitoring) monitors critical files for unauthorized changes by comparing cryptographic hashes against known-good baselines, detecting malware, unauthorized access, or system tampering. Antivirus detects malware, firewalls filter traffic, and routers direct traffic.|4.0 Security Operations|4.4 Monitoring Concepts
