They don't provide perfect isolation, hardware emulation, or direct hardware access.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

Which infrastructure model uses code to define and manage infrastructure?|Manual configuration|Infrastructure as Code (IaC)|Point-and-click management|Ad-hoc provisioning|1|Infrastructure as Code (IaC) uses code to define, provision, and manage infrastructure, enabling version control, repeatability, and automation. Manual configuration, point-and-click, and ad-hoc approaches are less consistent and harder to audit.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

What is a primary security concern with IoT devices?|Too much processing power|Weak default security and difficult patching|Excessive encryption|Over-authentication|1|IoT devices often have weak default credentials, limited security features, difficult or impossible patching, and long lifecycles with infrequent updates. They don't typically have too much power, excessive encryption, or over-authentication.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

Which architecture concept best describes on-premises infrastructure?|Cloud-native|On-premises/on-prem|Serverless|Hybrid|1|On-premises (on-prem) refers to infrastructure hosted in an organization's own facilities with full physical control. Cloud-native is designed for cloud, serverless abstracts infrastructure, and hybrid combines on-prem and cloud.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

What is the main security advantage of serverless computing?|Customer manages all security|Reduced attack surface through abstraction|More control over OS|Direct access to hypervisor|1|Serverless reduces attack surface by abstracting infrastructure management to the cloud provider. Customers focus on code, not OS, hypervisor, or infrastructure security. The provider handles patching and infrastructure security, though customers retain responsibility for application security.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models
What is the primary security advantage of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?|VPCs are automatically encrypted at rest|VPCs allow users to create isolated networks within the cloud with custom security controls|VPCs eliminate all network-based attacks|VPCs provide unlimited bandwidth|1|VPCs allow users to create isolated networks within the cloud, configuring highly secure environments that mimic traditional data center setups. Within a VPC, users can define subnets, route tables, network access control lists, and gateways, tailoring the network according to specific security and operational needs. This provides granular control over network segmentation and access controls in cloud environments.|3.0|3.1
Which type of hypervisor runs directly on the host hardware without an underlying operating system?|Type II hypervisor|Type I (bare-metal) hypervisor|Hosted hypervisor|Embedded hypervisor|1|Type I hypervisors, also known as "bare-metal" hypervisors, run directly on the host's hardware to control and manage guest operating systems. This type is preferred in enterprise environments due to its direct access to hardware resources, superior performance, and reduced attack surface since there is no underlying OS layer. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V (bare-metal mode), and Citrix XenServer.|3.0|3.1
What critical security vulnerability occurs when an attacker gains access to a virtual machine and exploits that access to interfere with the host or other VMs?|VM sprawl|VM escape|VM snapshot exposure|VM template injection|1|VM escape is a critical vulnerability that occurs when an attacker breaks out of a virtual machine and gains access to the hypervisor layer, potentially compromising the host system or other VMs on the same physical hardware. This represents a catastrophic security failure since the hypervisor is supposed to provide complete isolation between VMs. Properly configuring and regularly updating hypervisors with security patches is essential to mitigate this risk.|3.0|3.1
What technology combines SD-WAN with cloud security functions like CASB and FWaaS to support dynamic secure access needs?|MPLS|VPN concentrator|Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)|Software-Defined Networking (SDN)|2|SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) is a framework that combines network security functions such as Secure Web Gateways, CASB (Cloud Access Security Brokers), and FWaaS (Firewall as a Service) with WAN capabilities like SD-WAN to support the dynamic secure access needs of organizations. SASE models are ideal for enhancing security in organizations where remote working is prevalent, providing a cloud-native, edge-oriented security architecture with end-to-end protection regardless of where users are located.|3.0|3.1
What is the primary difference between containerization and traditional virtualization?|Containers require more resources than VMs|Containers share the host OS kernel while VMs run complete operating systems|Containers cannot be networked together|Containers are slower than VMs|1|Containers share the host operating system kernel and package applications with their dependencies in lightweight, isolated processes. This contrasts with traditional virtualization where each VM runs a complete guest operating system on top of a hypervisor. Containers are more resource-efficient, start faster, and provide process-level isolation, while VMs provide stronger isolation through hardware-level virtualization. Popular container platforms like Docker encapsulate applications in portable, standalone environments.|3.0|3.1
What orchestration platform is commonly used to manage the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications?|VMware vRealize|Kubernetes|Hyper-V Manager|AWS CloudFormation|1|Kubernetes is the industry-standard orchestration platform for container management that streamlines the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. Kubernetes provides automated container deployment, self-healing, horizontal scaling, load balancing, service discovery, and secrets management. It optimizes resource use across clusters and simplifies complex operational tasks, making it essential for production container environments running Docker or other OCI-compliant containers.|3.0|3.1
What network architecture approach uses a central controller to manage network devices through programmable interfaces?|Traditional routing|Software-Defined Networking (SDN)|MPLS|Circuit switching|1|Software-Defined Networking (SDN) separates the network control plane from the data plane, using centralized controllers to manage network devices through programmable interfaces (APIs). This approach enables network segmentation to be implemented dynamically through software rather than manual hardware configuration. SDN provides agility, automation, centralized visibility, and the ability to rapidly deploy security policies across the entire network infrastructure, making it valuable for both security segmentation and operational efficiency.|3.0|3.1
What type of network security architecture physically separates systems from networks to prevent network-based attacks?|VLAN segmentation|Air gap|Firewall zoning|Proxy filtering|1|An air gap is a security measure that physically isolates a system or network from other networks, meaning there is literally "air" between the system and external connectivity. This prevents network-based malware, remote attacks, and unauthorized data exfiltration. Air gaps are commonly used for critical infrastructure control systems, classified government networks, cryptocurrency cold wallets, and backup systems. However, they create operational challenges since updates and data transfer require manual physical media transport.|3.0|3.1
What network device serves as a single controlled entry point between lower-trust and higher-trust network zones?|Load balancer|Content delivery network|Jump server (bastion host)|Proxy server|2|A jump server, also called a bastion host, is a hardened system that serves as a single controlled entry point from untrusted networks into secured zones. All administrative access must go through the jump server, which is heavily monitored and logged. This creates a choke point for security controls, enabling centralized authentication, session recording, and access auditing. Jump servers are commonly used to access production environments from corporate networks or to manage cloud infrastructure from the internet.|3.0|3.1
In high availability architecture, what configuration allows both systems to actively process requests simultaneously?|Active-passive|Active-active|Cold standby|Warm standby|1|Active-active is a high availability configuration where multiple systems simultaneously process requests and share the workload. If one system fails, the others continue operating with minimal service disruption. This provides both high availability and load distribution, maximizing resource utilization. In contrast, active-passive configurations keep standby systems idle until the primary fails, and cold/warm standby systems require time to become operational. Active-active is commonly used with load balancers for web servers, application servers, and databases with replication.|3.0|3.1
What cloud infrastructure component allows load distribution across multiple servers to prevent bottlenecks?|Security group|Route table|Load balancer|NAT gateway|2|Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck, enhancing both performance and availability. They can operate at Layer 4 (transport layer - TCP/UDP) or Layer 7 (application layer - HTTP/HTTPS), with Layer 7 load balancers providing content-based routing and SSL offloading. Load balancers perform health checks to detect failed servers and automatically route traffic only to healthy instances, making them critical for high availability architectures.|3.0|3.1
What network design concept uses multiple layers of security controls to protect assets?|Single sign-on|Defense in depth|Zero trust|Least privilege|1|Defense in depth is a layered security strategy that employs multiple security controls at different levels of the IT infrastructure. If one layer fails, additional layers continue providing protection. This approach might include perimeter firewalls, network segmentation, host-based firewalls, intrusion detection, antivirus, access controls, encryption, and security awareness training. The concept originated from military defensive strategies and assumes that no single security measure is perfect, requiring redundant and complementary protections.|3.0|3.1
What deployment model allows organizations to connect multiple cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure?|Public cloud|Private cloud|Hybrid cloud|Community cloud|2|Hybrid cloud is a deployment model that combines on-premises infrastructure with one or more public or private cloud services, creating an integrated environment with orchestrated connectivity and data portability between platforms. This allows organizations to keep sensitive data on-premises while leveraging cloud scalability for less-sensitive workloads. Hybrid cloud requires careful attention to security boundaries, identity federation, consistent policy enforcement, and secure interconnection methods like dedicated circuits or VPN tunnels.|3.0|3.1
What is the primary purpose of network segmentation in security architecture?|Increase network speed|Limit lateral movement and contain security breaches|Reduce hardware costs|Simplify network management|1|Network segmentation divides a network into smaller isolated zones to limit lateral movement of attackers and contain security breaches. If an attacker compromises one segment, properly configured segmentation prevents them from easily accessing other network areas. Segmentation can be implemented physically with separate switches and cables, or logically using VLANs, software-defined networking, or firewalls. This is a fundamental security architecture principle that reduces the attack surface and blast radius of successful intrusions.|3.0|3.1
What geographically distributed network provides high performance by caching content close to end users?|VPN|SD-WAN|Content Delivery Network (CDN)|MPLS|2|Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are geographically distributed networks of proxy servers and data centers designed to provide high availability and high performance by distributing content spatially relative to end users. CDNs cache static content like images, videos, and JavaScript files at edge locations worldwide, reducing latency and improving load times. CDNs also provide DDoS protection, SSL/TLS termination, and can reduce origin server load. Examples include Cloudflare, Akamai, and AWS CloudFront.|3.0|3.1
What technology allows moving compute and data processing closer to IoT devices to reduce latency?|Cloud computing|Fog computing (edge computing)|Mainframe computing|Grid computing|1|Fog computing, also known as edge computing, extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network, closer to IoT devices and end users. This reduces latency for time-sensitive applications, decreases bandwidth usage by processing data locally, and allows continued operation during network outages. Edge computing is essential for autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, augmented reality, and smart cities where millisecond response times are critical. Processing occurs on edge devices or local edge servers before sending only relevant data to the cloud.|3.0|3.1
What network topology provides the highest redundancy by connecting each node to every other node?|Star topology|Bus topology|Ring topology|Mesh topology|3|Mesh topology connects each node directly to every other node in the network, providing maximum redundancy and fault tolerance. If any link fails, traffic can be rerouted through alternate paths. Full mesh provides the highest availability but becomes expensive and complex as the number of nodes increases (requiring n×(n-1)/2 connections for n nodes). Partial mesh is more common, connecting critical nodes with redundant paths while using simpler topologies for less-critical connections. Mesh topologies are used in WANs and critical infrastructure.|3.0|3.1
What cloud security tool sits between cloud service users and providers to enforce security policies?|VPN concentrator|Web application firewall|Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)|Intrusion detection system|2|Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs) sit between cloud service consumers and cloud providers to enforce enterprise security policies. CASBs provide visibility into cloud application usage (shadow IT discovery), data security controls (DLP, encryption), threat protection (malware detection, user behavior analytics), and compliance monitoring. They work across SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS environments through API-based integration or inline proxy modes. CASBs help organizations extend their security perimeter to cloud services they don't directly control.|3.0|3.1
In SD-WAN architecture, what is the primary advantage over traditional MPLS connections?|Higher latency|Cost reduction with intelligent routing over commodity Internet links|Decreased security|Limited bandwidth|1|SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) provides significant cost reduction compared to expensive MPLS circuits by intelligently routing traffic over lower-cost commodity Internet connections, broadband, or LTE links. SD-WAN controllers centrally manage policies, perform application-aware routing to optimize performance, provide built-in encryption, and can bond multiple connection types for redundancy and increased bandwidth. Unlike static MPLS routing, SD-WAN dynamically selects the best path based on real-time conditions, making it ideal for distributed organizations and cloud connectivity.|3.0|3.1
What security advantage does a Type I hypervisor provide compared to Type II?|Easier installation process|Reduced attack surface by running directly on hardware|Better desktop performance|Simplified licensing|1|Type I (bare-metal) hypervisors provide a reduced attack surface because they run directly on physical hardware without an underlying operating system layer. This eliminates vulnerabilities from host OS software, reduces the code base that could contain security flaws, and provides better isolation between VMs. Type II hypervisors run on top of a full operating system, inheriting all security vulnerabilities of that OS and creating additional attack vectors. Type I hypervisors are mandatory for enterprise production environments requiring strong security and performance.|3.0|3.1
What architectural concept ensures a system fails in a secure state when malfunction occurs?|Fail-open|Fail-closed|Fail-safe|Fail-over|1|Fail-safe (also called fail-closed or fail-secure) is a design principle ensuring that when a system malfunctions or loses power, it defaults to a secure state that denies access or blocks traffic. For example, electronic door locks should lock when power fails, and firewalls should block traffic if the security policy engine crashes. This contrasts with fail-open designs that prioritize availability over security. Security-critical systems should always implement fail-safe mechanisms, though this must be balanced with physical safety requirements like emergency exits.|3.0|3.1
What network design places public-facing servers between two firewalls to protect internal resources?|VLAN|Screened subnet (DMZ)|Air gap|Proxy server|1|A screened subnet, traditionally called a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone), places public-facing servers like web servers, email gateways, and DNS servers in an isolated network segment between two firewalls. The external firewall protects against Internet threats, while the internal firewall prevents compromised DMZ servers from attacking internal resources. This three-interface design (external, DMZ, internal) provides defense in depth by ensuring that even if a public server is compromised, attackers cannot directly access the internal network.|3.0|3.1
What technology allows organizations to define infrastructure configuration through code with version control?|Manual provisioning|Infrastructure as Code (IaC)|Legacy scripting|Point-and-click deployment|1|Infrastructure as Code (IaC) uses machine-readable definition files to provision and manage infrastructure rather than manual configuration processes. Tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Ansible allow infrastructure to be version-controlled in Git, code-reviewed, tested, and deployed consistently across environments. IaC enables immutable infrastructure where servers are replaced rather than patched, reduces configuration drift, provides audit trails of changes, and supports disaster recovery by enabling rapid infrastructure rebuilding from code.|3.0|3.1
What container security practice helps prevent deployment of vulnerable or malicious container images?|Disabling logging|Image scanning and signing|Removing health checks|Using deprecated base images|1|Container image scanning analyzes container images for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in OS packages and application dependencies before deployment. Digital signing verifies image integrity and authenticity, ensuring images haven't been tampered with and come from trusted sources. Tools like Trivy, Clair, and Anchore scan images during CI/CD pipelines, while Docker Content Trust and Notary provide signing capabilities. Organizations should scan images continuously, use minimal base images, remove unnecessary packages, and pull only from trusted registries with vulnerability thresholds enforced.|3.0|3.1
What Kubernetes security feature isolates resources and provides multi-tenancy within a cluster?|Pods|Services|Namespaces|ConfigMaps|2|Kubernetes namespaces provide virtual clusters within a physical cluster, enabling resource isolation and multi-tenancy. Namespaces allow teams to have separate environments with independent resource quotas, network policies, and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permissions. For example, development, staging, and production environments can exist in separate namespaces with strict access controls preventing developers from modifying production resources. Namespaces are essential for organizational separation, resource management, and security boundaries in shared Kubernetes clusters.|3.0|3.1
What architectural decision reduces attack surface for IoT devices with weak security capabilities?|Placing IoT devices directly on the Internet|Segmenting IoT devices to isolated VLANs with restricted access|Disabling all monitoring|Allowing IoT devices full network access|1|IoT devices often have weak default credentials, lack security updates, and contain exploitable vulnerabilities, making them attractive targets. Segmenting IoT devices to isolated VLANs or subnets with firewall rules restricting their communication reduces the attack surface significantly. IoT VLANs should prohibit device-to-device communication, allow only required outbound connections, prevent Internet access when possible, and require jump servers or VPNs for administrative access. This segmentation prevents compromised IoT devices from being used as pivot points to attack internal resources.|3.0|3.1
What load balancing method provides SSL/TLS termination and content-based routing?|Layer 2 load balancing|Layer 4 load balancing|Layer 7 load balancing|Layer 1 load balancing|2|Layer 7 (application layer) load balancers operate at the HTTP/HTTPS protocol level, enabling SSL/TLS termination, cookie-based session persistence, content-based routing (URL path, headers, cookies), and application-level health checks. This allows routing requests to different backend pools based on the requested content - for example, sending API requests to different servers than static content. Layer 7 load balancers can also provide Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities, request rewriting, and compression. However, they require more processing power than Layer 4 load balancers.|3.0|3.1
What multi-cloud strategy benefit allows avoiding dependence on a single cloud provider?|Increased complexity|Vendor lock-in prevention|Reduced security|Higher latency|1|Multi-cloud strategies use services from multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) to avoid vendor lock-in, increase negotiating leverage, leverage best-of-breed services, meet data residency requirements, and provide disaster recovery across providers. If one provider experiences outages or price increases, workloads can shift to alternatives. However, multi-cloud increases complexity in identity management, security policy enforcement, networking, monitoring, and cost management. Organizations should carefully balance the benefits of vendor independence against operational complexity.|3.0|3.1
What hypervisor security feature allows monitoring VM behavior from the hypervisor level without relying on the guest OS?|VM snapshots|VM templates|VM introspection|VM migration|2|VM introspection allows security tools running at the hypervisor level to monitor the behavior, memory, and network traffic of virtual machines without installing agents inside the guest OS. This "outside-in" visibility is particularly valuable for detecting malware that has compromised the guest OS and disabled security agents. Introspection techniques can detect rootkits, memory-based attacks, and abnormal process behavior that would be invisible to traditional antivirus. Products like VMware NSX and Bitdefender HVI use hypervisor introspection for agentless security.|3.0|3.1
What SD-WAN security feature protects data integrity and confidentiality across low-cost Internet connections?|Compression|Built-in IPsec encryption|QoS tagging|VLAN tagging|1|SD-WAN platforms include built-in IPsec or proprietary encryption to secure traffic traversing untrusted Internet connections, protecting data confidentiality and integrity without requiring separate VPN appliances. This encryption is automatically applied based on policy, with SD-WAN controllers managing key distribution and tunnel establishment between sites. Unlike traditional MPLS that provided inherent security through private circuits, SD-WAN's use of commodity Internet requires encryption. Modern SD-WAN solutions also integrate firewalls, IPS, and secure web gateways for comprehensive security.|3.0|3.1
What cloud deployment challenge involves maintaining consistent security policies across diverse environments?|Resource exhaustion|Policy sprawl|Bandwidth limitation|Physical security|1|Policy sprawl occurs when organizations struggle to maintain consistent security policies across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, each with different native security controls, identity systems, and configuration methods. AWS security groups, Azure NSGs, and on-premises firewall rules may contradict each other, creating gaps or misconfigurations. Solutions include cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools, infrastructure as code for consistent deployment, policy-as-code frameworks, and centralized security policy engines that translate unified policies into provider-specific configurations.|3.0|3.1
What network design principle limits damage by creating intentional bottlenecks for traffic inspection?|Distributed architecture|Choke points|Mesh networking|Broadcast domains|1|Choke points are intentional network bottlenecks where all traffic must pass through security controls for inspection, logging, and policy enforcement. Examples include internet gateways, VPN concentrators, screened subnet firewalls, and jump servers. While choke points can become single points of failure requiring high availability designs, they provide centralized visibility and control that distributed architectures lack. Choke points enable consistent policy enforcement, comprehensive logging, and simplified incident response by consolidating security functions at strategic network junctions.|3.0|3.1
What serverless computing security advantage reduces attack surface through abstraction?|Increased OS management burden|Direct hardware access|Provider manages underlying infrastructure and patching|Manual scaling requirements|2|Serverless computing (Function-as-a-Service) abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, with the cloud provider responsible for OS patching, server hardening, and capacity management. Developers deploy only application code, dramatically reducing the attack surface since there are no servers to secure, patch, or configure. The provider handles security updates, DDoS protection, and infrastructure resilience. However, serverless introduces new concerns like function-level access controls, event injection attacks, and dependency vulnerabilities that must be addressed through code review and runtime protection.|3.0|3.1
What microsegmentation approach creates workload-level security policies independent of network topology?|Traditional firewall rules|Identity-based microsegmentation|Subnet-based segmentation|Port-based VLANs|1|Identity-based microsegmentation (also called zero trust network segmentation) creates security policies that follow workloads regardless of their network location, using workload identity rather than IP addresses. This approach, implemented by platforms like VMware NSX, Cisco ACI, and Illumio, allows granular policies like "web servers can only communicate with app servers on port 8080" that remain enforced even when VMs migrate between hosts or networks. This is essential for cloud and containerized environments where IP addresses are ephemeral and traditional subnet-based segmentation breaks down.|3.0|3.1
What architectural pattern rapidly replaces entire servers rather than patching them in place?|Legacy maintenance|Immutable infrastructure|Manual configuration|Persistent servers|1|Immutable infrastructure treats servers as disposable units that are never modified after deployment - instead of patching or updating running servers, new servers are built from updated images and old servers are destroyed. This "cattle, not pets" approach eliminates configuration drift, makes rollbacks instant (revert to previous image), simplifies disaster recovery, and reduces security risk since servers cannot accumulate malware or misconfigurations over time. Immutable infrastructure is enabled by infrastructure as code, containerization, and automated CI/CD pipelines.|3.0|3.1
What container runtime security practice prevents containers from gaining excessive host privileges?|Running containers as root|Disabling SELinux|Dropping unnecessary Linux capabilities and using non-root users|Mounting the entire host filesystem|2|Container runtime security requires running containers with least privilege by dropping unnecessary Linux capabilities (like CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_NET_RAW), using non-root users inside containers, enabling read-only root filesystems, and applying security profiles like AppArmor or SELinux. Containers should never run as UID 0 (root) since a container escape would provide root access to the host. Tools like Docker's --security-opt, Kubernetes security contexts, and admission controllers enforce these restrictions, preventing containers from loading kernel modules, manipulating the network stack, or accessing host resources unnecessarily.|3.0|3.1
What cloud-native security model focuses on protecting applications regardless of where they run?|Perimeter-based security|Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)|Traditional firewall rules|Port-based filtering|1|Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), also called Software-Defined Perimeter, focuses on protecting applications rather than networks by assuming no implicit trust and requiring continuous verification. ZTNA authenticates users and devices before establishing encrypted micro-tunnels directly to specific applications, making the network invisible to unauthorized users. This replaces VPNs that grant broad network access with granular, application-level access controls that work for on-premises, cloud, and SaaS resources. ZTNA is essential for remote work, BYOD, and cloud-first architectures where traditional perimeters no longer exist.|3.0|3.1
What high availability database architecture allows multiple servers to accept writes simultaneously?|Read replica|Active-passive failover|Multi-master replication|Backup restoration|2|Multi-master (active-active) replication allows multiple database servers to accept write operations simultaneously, with changes automatically synchronized between all masters. This provides both high availability and geographic distribution, allowing low-latency local writes. However, multi-master replication introduces challenges with conflict resolution when different masters receive conflicting updates to the same data. Solutions include last-write-wins, application-level conflict resolution, or distributed consensus protocols. Multi-master is commonly used with MySQL Group Replication, PostgreSQL with Bucardo, and distributed databases like Cassandra and Couchbase.|3.0|3.1
What network function virtualization benefit allows rapid deployment of security services?|Hardware lock-in|Software-based network functions that deploy in minutes|Increased physical footprint|Manual configuration|1|Network Function Virtualization (NFV) replaces proprietary hardware appliances (routers, firewalls, load balancers, IDS/IPS) with software running on standard commodity servers or virtual machines. This allows rapid deployment of network services in minutes instead of weeks, easy scaling by adding more instances, simplified upgrades by deploying new software versions, and reduced costs by eliminating specialized hardware. NFV enables service chaining where traffic flows through virtualized security functions in sequence, with policies dynamically orchestrated through centralized controllers.|3.0|3.1
What container security concern involves scanning registries for vulnerable or unauthorized images?|Network segmentation|Container image sprawl and unauthorized images|Log aggregation|Certificate rotation|1|Container image sprawl occurs when organizations lose track of container images stored in registries, leading to deployment of outdated images with known vulnerabilities, unauthorized images from untrusted sources, or accumulation of orphaned images wasting storage. Organizations should implement registry security by: enabling image scanning (Trivy, Clair), requiring image signing for deployment, using admission controllers to enforce policies, maintaining approved base image catalogs, implementing automated image retirement, and monitoring deployed images for newly disclosed vulnerabilities.|3.0|3.1
