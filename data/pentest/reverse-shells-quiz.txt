What is a reverse shell?|A shell that listens for incoming connections|A shell that connects back to the attacker's machine|A local shell on the victim's system|A shell that encrypts all communications|1|A reverse shell connects from the compromised system back to the attacker's machine, bypassing firewall restrictions.|pentest|reverse-shells
Why are reverse shells effective against firewalls?|They use inbound connections that are typically blocked|They use outbound connections that are often allowed|They don't require network access|They bypass all firewall rules|1|Reverse shells use outbound connections from the victim to the attacker, which firewalls typically allow for normal internet access.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is the main difference between a bind shell and a reverse shell?|Bind shells are more secure|Bind shells connect from attacker to victim, reverse shells connect from victim to attacker|Bind shells work through NAT, reverse shells don't|Bind shells require physical access|1|Bind shells listen on the victim for attacker connections, while reverse shells initiate connections from victim to attacker.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which Python function is used to duplicate file descriptors in a reverse shell?|socket.dup()|os.dup2()|subprocess.dup()|sys.dup()|1|os.dup2() is used to redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to the socket file descriptor in Python reverse shells.|pentest|reverse-shells
What does the Metasploit multi/handler do?|Generates payloads|Receives reverse shell connections|Scans for vulnerabilities|Exploits systems|1|The multi/handler module in Metasploit is used to receive and handle incoming reverse shell connections.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which Meterpreter command shows system information?|sysinfo|getuid|ps|netstat|0|The sysinfo command displays detailed system information including OS version, architecture, and computer name.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is persistence in the context of reverse shells?|Maintaining shell access after system reboot|Encrypting shell communications|Using multiple shell types|Creating backup connections|0|Persistence mechanisms ensure that reverse shell access is maintained even after system reboots or user logouts.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which tool can detect reverse shells by monitoring network connections?|tcpdump|netstat|Both tcpdump and netstat|ps|2|Both tcpdump and netstat can monitor network connections and help identify suspicious reverse shell traffic.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is a common port used for reverse shells?|22 (SSH)|80 (HTTP)|443 (HTTPS)|4444|3|Port 4444 is commonly used for reverse shells as it's not typically used by legitimate services and is easy to remember.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which Metasploit payload uses HTTP for communication?|reverse_tcp|reverse_http|reverse_https|reverse_dns|1|The reverse_http payload uses HTTP protocol for communication, which can be more firewall-friendly.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is the purpose of encoding in Metasploit payloads?|To make them smaller|To avoid antivirus detection|To speed up execution|To add encryption|1|Encoding payloads helps avoid signature-based antivirus detection by obfuscating the payload code.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which command in Meterpreter uploads a file to the victim?|upload|download|get|put|0|The upload command transfers a file from the attacker's machine to the victim's system.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is a beacon in the context of reverse shells?|A signal sent to indicate the shell is active|A type of encryption|A firewall bypass technique|A persistence mechanism|0|Beacons are periodic signals sent by reverse shells to indicate they are still active and ready to receive commands.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which of these is NOT a common reverse shell technique?|Bash TCP reverse shell|Python socket reverse shell|Windows registry reverse shell|PHP system() reverse shell|2|Windows registry reverse shell is not a standard technique; the others are common methods using different languages.|pentest|reverse-shells
What does the 'clearev' command do in Meterpreter?|Clears event logs|Cleans temporary files|Closes the shell|Changes privileges|0|The clearev command clears Windows event logs to cover tracks and remove evidence of the compromise.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which protocol is commonly used for very stealthy reverse shells?|ICMP|UDP|TCP|HTTP|0|ICMP (ping) can be used to tunnel reverse shell traffic, making it very stealthy as ping traffic is rarely blocked.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is the main advantage of using HTTPS for reverse shells?|Faster communication|Better encryption|More ports available|All traffic looks legitimate|3|HTTPS reverse shells blend in with normal web traffic, making them harder to detect in network monitoring.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which tool can create encrypted reverse shell payloads?|msfvenom|nc|bash|python|0|msfvenom from Metasploit can generate various types of payloads including encrypted ones.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is lateral movement in post-exploitation?|Moving to other systems on the network|Escalating privileges on the current system|Installing persistence|Exfiltrating data|0|Lateral movement involves using the compromised system to access other systems on the same network.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which Meterpreter command attempts privilege escalation?|getsystem|sysinfo|getuid|ps|0|The getsystem command attempts various techniques to escalate privileges to SYSTEM or Administrator level.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is a web shell?|A shell that runs in a web browser|A PHP script that provides shell access via HTTP|A graphical shell interface|A shell that only works on web servers|1|A web shell is typically a PHP, ASP, or other web script that provides shell access through HTTP requests.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which of these is a common persistence mechanism?|Adding to startup folder|Creating a service|Adding to cron|All of the above|3|All of these are common persistence mechanisms used to maintain access after system reboots.|pentest|reverse-shells
What does the 'timestomp' command do in Meterpreter?|Changes file timestamps|Deletes temporary files|Stops services|Changes file permissions|0|Timestomp changes file timestamps to make files appear older or newer, helping to avoid detection.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which reverse shell type is most likely to be detected by network monitoring?|Plain TCP reverse shell|HTTP reverse shell|DNS tunneling reverse shell|ICMP tunneling reverse shell|0|Plain TCP reverse shells on unusual ports are more likely to be flagged by network monitoring than those using common protocols.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is the purpose of the 'run persistence' command in Meterpreter?|Runs a persistence script|Creates a persistent backdoor|Shows running processes|Lists installed services|1|The run persistence command creates a persistent backdoor that will reconnect automatically.|pentest|reverse-shells
Which language is commonly used for web shells?|Java|C++|PHP|Assembly|2|PHP is commonly used for web shells as it's widely supported on web servers and can execute system commands.|pentest|reverse-shells
What is command and control (C2) in the context of reverse shells?|Controlling multiple shells at once|Encrypting shell communications|The attacker's server that receives shell connections|Monitoring shell activity|2|Command and control refers to the attacker's server infrastructure that receives and manages reverse shell connections.|pentest|reverse-shells
