What is the primary goal of AI-powered OSINT in advanced reconnaissance?|To manually collect basic information about targets|To automate data collection, identify patterns, and predict attack vectors using machine learning|To replace human analysts entirely in reconnaissance operations|To focus only on social media intelligence gathering|1|AI-powered OSINT enhances traditional Open Source Intelligence by automating data collection across multiple sources, using pattern recognition to identify anomalies, and applying machine learning to predict likely attack vectors based on historical data and target characteristics.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
Which of the following is NOT typically collected during comprehensive OSINT gathering?|Email addresses|Domain certificates|Social media profiles|Internal network configurations|3|OSINT focuses on publicly available information. Internal network configurations would require active reconnaissance or insider access, which goes beyond open source intelligence gathering.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
In certificate analysis, what does the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension reveal?|The certificate's encryption algorithm|Additional domains covered by the certificate|The certificate authority's location|The certificate's expiration date|1|Subject Alternative Names allow a single certificate to be valid for multiple domain names, revealing the full scope of domains owned or managed by an organization.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
What is Certificate Transparency (CT) and why is it valuable for reconnaissance?|A logging system that records SSL/TLS certificates in public logs|An encryption protocol for secure communications|A method for certificate revocation| A type of certificate authority|0|Certificate Transparency logs record all certificates issued by public CAs, allowing security researchers to monitor certificate issuance and discover new domains or suspicious certificate patterns.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
During metadata extraction, which file type commonly contains EXIF data with geolocation information?|PDF documents|JPEG images|Word documents|HTML files|1|EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data in image files often contains GPS coordinates, camera information, and timestamps that can reveal location and device information.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
What security header helps prevent clickjacking attacks and should be analyzed during web reconnaissance?|Content-Security-Policy|X-Frame-Options|Strict-Transport-Security|X-Content-Type-Options|1|X-Frame-Options prevents websites from being embedded in frames, protecting against clickjacking attacks where malicious sites trick users into interacting with hidden frames.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
In AI-powered OSINT analysis, what does anomaly detection help identify?|Normal patterns in collected data|Outliers and unusual patterns that may indicate security issues|The most common data types|Standard encryption algorithms|1|Anomaly detection algorithms identify statistical outliers in metadata and OSINT data that may indicate sensitive information disclosure, unusual network patterns, or potential security vulnerabilities.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
What is a common pitfall when performing certificate chain analysis?|Focusing only on the leaf certificate|Ignoring the certificate authority validation|Analyzing only expired certificates|Checking only the subject name|1|Certificate chain analysis must examine the entire chain of trust, including intermediate certificates and root CA validation, not just the leaf certificate presented by the server.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
Which metadata field in documents often reveals the software used to create or modify the file?|File size|Creation timestamp|Application name in producer/creator fields|File permissions|2|Producer and creator fields in document metadata typically contain the software application name and version used to create or modify the file, revealing the technology stack.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
What type of attack vector can be discovered through metadata analysis of image files?|SQL injection|Geolocation tracking|Cross-site scripting|Buffer overflow|1|GPS metadata in image files can reveal physical locations of individuals or facilities, enabling targeted physical security assessments or social engineering attacks.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
In web resource analysis, what does the 'Server' HTTP header typically reveal?|Client browser information|Web server software and version|Database type|Programming language|1|The Server header often discloses the web server software (e.g., Apache, nginx) and version, providing valuable information about the technology stack.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
What is the primary purpose of Certificate Transparency logs?|To encrypt certificate data|To provide public, tamper-proof records of certificate issuance|To validate certificate chains|To generate certificate signing requests|1|Certificate Transparency creates publicly auditable logs of all certificates issued by Certificate Authorities, enabling detection of mistakenly issued or malicious certificates.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
During metadata extraction, what type of sensitive information might be found in document properties?|Network configurations|Author names and revision history|Database credentials|API endpoints|1|Document metadata often contains author information, revision history, and organizational details that can be valuable for social engineering or understanding organizational structure.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
What security assessment technique involves analyzing multiple metadata sources to identify patterns?|Single file analysis|Metadata correlation|Basic header checking|Manual inspection|1|Metadata correlation involves analyzing metadata from multiple sources to identify patterns, such as technology stacks, user entities, or temporal indicators that provide broader intelligence.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
Which of the following is a common indicator of sensitive information in metadata?|Standard file timestamps|References to 'password' or 'API key' in field values|Normal file sizes|Standard document titles|1|Metadata fields containing terms like 'password', 'API key', 'token', or 'secret' often indicate sensitive information that should be flagged for security review.|pentest|2.0-reconnaissance-enumeration
