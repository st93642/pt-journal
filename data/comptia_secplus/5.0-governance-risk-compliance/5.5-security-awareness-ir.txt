What is the primary goal of security awareness training?|Replace all technical controls|Reduce human-related security incidents through education|Eliminate all security risks|Install security software|1|Security awareness training educates users about threats, policies, and best practices to reduce human-related incidents like phishing, social engineering, and policy violations. It complements but doesn't replace technical controls, and can't eliminate all risks.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

Which incident response phase involves identifying and analyzing potential incidents?|Preparation|Detection and Analysis|Containment|Recovery|1|Detection and Analysis phase involves monitoring for, identifying, and analyzing potential security incidents to determine their nature and scope. Preparation happens before incidents, containment stops spread, and recovery restores systems.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

What is the first phase of the incident response lifecycle?|Containment|Detection|Preparation|Lessons learned|2|Preparation is the first phase—establishing incident response capabilities, procedures, tools, and training before incidents occur. Detection identifies incidents, containment stops spread, and lessons learned concludes the process.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

Which incident response phase focuses on stopping the incident from spreading?|Detection|Containment, Eradication, and Recovery|Preparation|Post-incident activity|1|Containment stops incidents from spreading to additional systems. Eradication removes the threat, and recovery restores normal operations. Detection identifies incidents, preparation happens beforehand, and post-incident activity includes lessons learned.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

What should organizations do after resolving a security incident?|Nothing|Conduct lessons learned/post-incident review|Delete all records|Ignore it|1|Post-incident activity should include lessons learned sessions to identify what went well, what needs improvement, and how to prevent similar incidents. Organizations shouldn't do nothing, delete evidence, or ignore incidents—they should learn and improve.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

Which metric measures the average time to detect a security incident?|MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)|MTTR (Mean Time To Respond)|MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)|RTO (Recovery Time Objective)|0|MTTD (Mean Time To Detect) measures average time to identify security incidents. MTTR measures time to respond/resolve, MTBF measures system reliability, and RTO is disaster recovery objective.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

What is the purpose of tabletop exercises in incident response?|Physical exercise|Discuss and walk through incident scenarios to test plans|Replace actual response plans|Avoid planning|1|Tabletop exercises involve discussion-based walkthroughs of incident scenarios to test response plans, identify gaps, and train personnel without system disruption. They're not physical exercises, they don't replace plans, and they support planning.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

Which team typically leads incident response activities?|Marketing team|Security Operations Center (SOC) or Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)|Sales team|Accounting department|1|SOC or CSIRT teams typically lead incident response, providing 24/7 monitoring, detection, analysis, and coordination. Marketing, sales, and accounting aren't security incident response teams, though they may be stakeholders.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

What should be preserved during incident response for potential legal action?|Nothing|Evidence through proper chain of custody|Only screenshots|Random files|1|Evidence must be preserved with proper chain of custody documentation tracking who handled it, when, and how to maintain admissibility in legal proceedings. Screenshots alone are insufficient, random files may miss critical evidence, and doing nothing loses evidence.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

Which communication is essential during security incidents?|No communication|Clear, timely communication with stakeholders and response team|Only social media posts|Ignoring everyone|1|Clear, timely communication with stakeholders (management, legal, PR, affected parties) and response team members is essential for coordinated, effective incident response. No communication, only social media, or ignoring stakeholders creates chaos and may violate requirements.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR

What is phishing simulation training?|Real phishing attacks|Controlled phishing exercises to educate users and measure awareness|Illegal activity|Actual fraud|1|Phishing simulation training involves controlled, ethical phishing exercises to educate users, measure awareness levels, and identify training needs. It's not real attacks, illegal, or actual fraud—it's sanctioned training activity with user consent/awareness policies.|5.0 Security Program Management|5.5 Security Awareness and IR
