Which AWS IAM action allows a user to pass a role to a service, potentially enabling privilege escalation?|iam:CreateRole|iam:PassRole|iam:AssumeRole|iam:AttachRolePolicy|1|iam:PassRole allows a principal to pass an IAM role to an AWS service (like Lambda or EC2), which can then assume that role. If the passed role has higher privileges, this can lead to privilege escalation. This is a common AWS privilege escalation primitive.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

In Azure RBAC, which built-in role allows a principal to grant additional role assignments to others?|Contributor|Reader|Owner|User Access Administrator|3|The User Access Administrator role in Azure allows principals to manage user access to Azure resources by granting role assignments, but does not provide access to the resources themselves. The Owner role also has this capability, but User Access Administrator is specifically designed for delegation.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

What GCP IAM permission allows an attacker to create keys for service accounts, potentially enabling impersonation?|iam.serviceAccounts.create|iam.serviceAccounts.actAs|iam.serviceAccountKeys.create|iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy|2|iam.serviceAccountKeys.create allows a principal to generate new keys for a service account. If the service account has elevated privileges, an attacker with this permission can create a key and authenticate as that service account, escalating their privileges.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

Which of the following is NOT a recommended defense against cloud IAM privilege escalation?|Implementing least privilege access|Requiring MFA for sensitive operations|Using wildcard permissions in policies|Enabling comprehensive audit logging|2|Using wildcard permissions (Action: *, Resource: *) is a dangerous practice that grants overly broad access and is a common source of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Least privilege, MFA, and audit logging are all recommended security controls.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

What is the purpose of AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs)?|To grant permissions to IAM users|To enforce permission boundaries across AWS accounts|To encrypt data at rest|To monitor CloudTrail logs|1|Service Control Policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy used in AWS Organizations to manage permissions across multiple AWS accounts. They set maximum available permissions for accounts and act as permission guardrails that cannot be overridden by IAM policies within member accounts.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

In the context of cloud IAM, what does 'sts:AssumeRole' allow a principal to do?|Create new IAM users|Obtain temporary credentials for a different role|Delete IAM policies|Modify resource tags|1|sts:AssumeRole allows a principal to request temporary security credentials for an IAM role. This is commonly used for cross-account access and privilege escalation. The AssumeRole API returns temporary credentials that can be used to access resources permitted by the target role.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

Which Azure AD feature provides just-in-time privileged access with approval workflows?|Conditional Access|Managed Identities|Privileged Identity Management (PIM)|Azure Policy|2|Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions. It implements just-in-time access where users must request and justify elevated privileges.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

What is a common indicator of overly permissive IAM policies in AWS?|Policies with explicit deny statements|Policies with resource-level permissions|Policies containing 'Action: *' or 'Resource: *'|Policies with condition keys|2|Policies containing wildcards for actions ('Action: *') or resources ('Resource: *') grant overly broad permissions and violate the principle of least privilege. These are common misconfigurations that can lead to privilege escalation and should be avoided except in rare, justified circumstances.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

In GCP, what does the 'roles/owner' primitive role provide?|Read-only access to all resources|Full access to all resources including IAM management|Network configuration access only|Billing administration access only|1|The roles/owner primitive role in GCP grants full access to all resources, including the ability to manage IAM policies and role bindings. It is the highest level of access and should be granted sparingly. In production environments, predefined or custom roles with specific permissions are preferred.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

Which tool is specifically designed for AWS privilege escalation enumeration and exploitation in authorized assessments?|Terraform|CloudFormation|Pacu|Ansible|2|Pacu is an open-source AWS exploitation framework designed for offensive security testing of AWS environments. It includes modules for privilege escalation, data exfiltration, and persistence, and should only be used in authorized penetration tests with proper written authorization.|Cloud & Identity Security|IAM Privilege Escalation

Which HTTP response code commonly indicates that an S3 bucket allows anonymous listing of objects?|301 Redirect|403 Forbidden|404 Not Found|200 OK|3|A 200 OK response from an unauthenticated GET or LIST request typically means the bucket allows public access. Attackers can enumerate object keys and metadata, which can reveal sensitive information.|Cloud & Identity Security|Cloud Storage Security

In Google Cloud Storage, what does granting the member 'allUsers' the role 'roles/storage.objectViewer' achieve?|Only project members can read objects|Anyone on the internet can read objects|Only authenticated Google users can read objects|Objects become encrypted|1|Granting the 'allUsers' member any role makes the bucket or object public on the internet. The role 'roles/storage.objectViewer' allows anyone to list and download objects, which is a common misconfiguration leading to data exposure.|Cloud & Identity Security|Cloud Storage Security

Which OAuth 2.0 parameter is designed to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) during the authorization process?|scope|state|response_type|aud|1|The 'state' parameter is an opaque value created by the client and returned by the authorization server. The client must verify the returned state value to ensure the response matches the request, preventing CSRF attacks.|Cloud & Identity Security|OAuth/OIDC Security

During OAuth testing you discover that any domain can be supplied in the redirect_uri parameter and the authorization server accepts it. What risk does this create?|Token binding|Open redirect leading to authorization code theft|PKCE enforcement|Refresh token rotation|1|If redirect_uri values are not strictly validated, an attacker can supply their own domain, capture authorization codes or tokens, and impersonate users—an open redirect vulnerability in the OAuth flow.|Cloud & Identity Security|OAuth/OIDC Security

What prerequisite is required for a Golden SAML attack?|Valid OAuth refresh token|Compromised SAML token-signing certificate|Access to user passwords|Misconfigured redirect URI|1|Golden SAML attacks require the attacker to obtain the SAML token-signing certificate (or private key) from the identity provider. With this key, attackers can forge SAML assertions for any user, including administrators.|Cloud & Identity Security|Federation Security

Accepting unsigned or partially signed SAML assertions primarily enables which attack? |Privilege escalation through validated MFA tokens|Assertion tampering and impersonation|Denial-of-service|Token binding failure|1|If a service provider accepts unsigned or partially signed SAML assertions, an attacker can modify claims (such as username or roles) without detection, leading to impersonation or privilege escalation.|Cloud & Identity Security|Federation Security
