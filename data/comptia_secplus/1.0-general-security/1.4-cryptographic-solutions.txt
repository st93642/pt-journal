What is the main difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?|Speed of encryption|Symmetric uses one key, asymmetric uses two keys|Symmetric is more secure|Asymmetric is older technology|1|Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Symmetric is generally faster but key distribution is challenging. Security depends on implementation, and asymmetric is actually newer.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

Which cryptographic concept ensures that encrypted data cannot be read without the proper key?|Integrity|Confidentiality|Availability|Non-repudiation|1|Confidentiality is ensured through encryption, which makes data unreadable without the proper decryption key. Integrity ensures data hasn't been modified, availability ensures access, and non-repudiation prevents denial of actions.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

What is the purpose of a cryptographic hash function?|To encrypt messages|To create a fixed-size unique fingerprint of data|To exchange keys securely|To verify user identity|1|Hash functions create a fixed-size, unique fingerprint (digest) of data. Any change to the data produces a different hash. Hashes are one-way functions used for integrity verification, not encryption. Encryption protects confidentiality, key exchange uses other methods, and authentication uses multiple techniques.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

Which component of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) issues digital certificates?|Key server|Certificate Authority (CA)|Registration Authority (RA)|Certificate Revocation List (CRL)|1|A Certificate Authority (CA) is the trusted entity that issues, signs, and revokes digital certificates. The Registration Authority verifies certificate requests, key servers store keys, and CRL lists revoked certificates.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

What cryptographic technique adds random data to passwords before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks?|Peppering|Salting|Key stretching|Initialization vectors|1|Salting adds random data to each password before hashing, ensuring identical passwords have different hashes and making rainbow table attacks ineffective. Peppering adds a secret value, key stretching makes hashing slower, and initialization vectors are used in encryption algorithms.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

Which encryption type is faster but requires secure key exchange?|Asymmetric encryption|Symmetric encryption|Quantum encryption|Homomorphic encryption|1|Symmetric encryption is much faster than asymmetric but requires both parties to have the same key, creating a key exchange challenge. Asymmetric solves key exchange but is slower. Quantum and homomorphic are specialized encryption types.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

What does a digital signature provide?|Confidentiality only|Authentication and non-repudiation|Faster encryption|Anonymous communication|1|Digital signatures provide authentication (proves who sent the message) and non-repudiation (sender cannot deny sending it). They use the sender's private key to sign and public key to verify. They don't provide confidentiality or speed, and they identify rather than anonymize.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

Which PKI component maintains a list of revoked certificates?|Certificate Authority (CA)|Certificate Revocation List (CRL)|Registration Authority (RA)|Root certificate|1|The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of certificates that have been revoked before their expiration date due to compromise or other reasons. The CA maintains the CRL and issues certificates. RA verifies requests, and root certificates are top-level certificates.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

What is key stretching used for in cryptography?|Making keys longer physically|Making weak passwords more resistant to brute-force attacks|Stretching key validity periods|Distributing keys to more users|1|Key stretching applies a cryptographic function repeatedly (often thousands of times) to make weak passwords more resistant to brute-force attacks by significantly increasing the time required to test each password. It doesn't physically lengthen keys, extend validity, or relate to distribution.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

Which cryptographic algorithm is currently recommended for symmetric encryption?|DES|3DES|AES|RC4|2|AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is the current recommended symmetric encryption algorithm. DES and 3DES are deprecated due to security weaknesses, and RC4 is considered insecure. AES with 256-bit keys (AES-256) provides strong security for most applications.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

What is the primary purpose of blockchain technology in security?|Fast data processing|Creating an immutable, distributed ledger|Encrypting all data|Replacing traditional databases|1|Blockchain creates an immutable, distributed ledger where transactions are cryptographically linked and cannot be altered once recorded. This provides transparency, integrity, and auditability. Blockchain is not primarily about speed or encryption, and it complements rather than replaces traditional databases.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions

Which protocol is used to check if a digital certificate has been revoked?|HTTPS|OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)|SSH|SFTP|1|OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) provides real-time certificate validation by checking with the CA whether a certificate has been revoked. It's more efficient than downloading entire CRLs. HTTPS, SSH, and SFTP are protocols that may use certificates but don't check revocation status themselves.|1.0 General Security Concepts|1.4 Cryptographic Solutions
