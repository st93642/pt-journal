What mitigation technique divides networks into isolated segments to limit attack spread?|Encryption|Segmentation|Authentication|Monitoring|1|Segmentation (network segmentation) divides networks into isolated segments or zones to limit lateral movement and contain potential breaches. If one segment is compromised, others remain protected. Encryption protects data confidentiality, authentication verifies identity, and monitoring detects threats.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

Which mitigation technique ensures users have only the minimum necessary access?|Defense in depth|Least privilege|Separation of duties|Job rotation|1|Least privilege principle ensures users are granted only the minimum access rights necessary to perform their job functions, reducing potential damage from compromised accounts. Defense in depth uses layers, separation of duties divides responsibilities, and job rotation moves people between roles.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

What is the primary purpose of patching systems regularly?|Improve performance|Fix known vulnerabilities|Add new features|Reduce costs|1|Patching systems regularly fixes known vulnerabilities and security flaws before they can be exploited. While patches may include performance improvements or features, security is the primary purpose from a threat mitigation perspective.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

Which technique uses multiple layers of security controls for defense?|Single sign-on|Defense in depth|Least privilege|Encryption|1|Defense in depth (layered security) implements multiple layers of security controls so that if one fails, others still provide protection. This redundancy prevents single points of failure. SSO simplifies authentication, least privilege limits access, and encryption protects data.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

What mitigation approach allows only approved applications to run?|Blocklist|Application allow list|Antivirus|Firewall|1|Application allow listing (whitelisting) allows only approved, known-good applications to execute, blocking everything else by default. This is more secure than blocklisting which tries to block known-bad applications. Antivirus detects malware, and firewalls control network traffic.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

Which technique removes systems from production that are no longer needed?|Patching|Hardening|Decommissioning|Monitoring|2|Decommissioning is the secure removal of systems, applications, or services from production when they're no longer needed. This reduces attack surface by eliminating unnecessary assets. Patching fixes vulnerabilities, hardening strengthens security, and monitoring detects threats.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

What hardening technique disables unnecessary services and features?|Installing all available features|Reducing attack surface|Enabling guest accounts|Opening all ports|1|Reducing attack surface by disabling unnecessary services, features, ports, and accounts is a key hardening technique that minimizes potential entry points for attackers. Installing extra features, enabling guest accounts, and opening ports increase attack surface.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

Which mitigation uses cryptography to protect data confidentiality?|Hashing|Encryption|Segmentation|Monitoring|1|Encryption uses cryptographic algorithms to protect data confidentiality by making it unreadable without the proper decryption key. Hashing creates fingerprints for integrity, segmentation isolates networks, and monitoring detects threats.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

What technique isolates untrusted or suspicious systems from the main network?|Integration|Isolation|Correlation|Federation|1|Isolation separates untrusted, suspicious, or compromised systems from the main network to prevent spread of malware or lateral movement. Integration connects systems, correlation analyzes relationships, and federation connects identity systems.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

Which technique continuously watches systems and networks for security events?|Patching|Encryption|Monitoring|Segmentation|2|Monitoring continuously observes systems, networks, and user activities for security events, anomalies, or indicators of compromise. This enables early threat detection and response. Patching fixes vulnerabilities, encryption protects data, and segmentation isolates networks.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

What mitigation technique standardizes and enforces security settings?|Configuration enforcement|Random configuration|Varied settings|Ad-hoc management|0|Configuration enforcement (configuration management) standardizes and enforces security settings across systems through baselines, templates, and automated tools. This ensures consistent security posture and prevents configuration drift. Random, varied, or ad-hoc approaches reduce security.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques

Which access control method grants permissions based on job roles?|Mandatory Access Control (MAC)|Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)|Discretionary Access Control (DAC)|Rule-Based Access Control|1|Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns permissions based on job roles, simplifying administration and ensuring users have appropriate access for their positions. MAC enforces classifications, DAC allows owners to control access, and rule-based uses conditions.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.5 Mitigation Techniques
