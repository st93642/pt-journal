What type of vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious SQL commands into database queries?|Cross-site scripting (XSS)|SQL injection|Buffer overflow|Directory traversal|1|SQL injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to insert malicious SQL commands into input fields that are used in database queries. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. XSS targets browsers, buffer overflow targets memory, and directory traversal accesses files.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

Which vulnerability type allows attackers to write data beyond allocated memory boundaries?|Memory leak|Buffer overflow|Integer overflow|Race condition|1|Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer boundaries, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and allowing arbitrary code execution. Memory leaks waste memory, integer overflows cause numerical errors, and race conditions involve timing issues.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

What vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users?|SQL injection|Cross-site scripting (XSS)|Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)|Directory traversal|1|Cross-site scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages that are then executed in other users' browsers. SQL injection targets databases, CSRF exploits authenticated sessions, and directory traversal accesses files.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

Which vulnerability allows unauthorized access to files and directories outside the web root?|SQL injection|Directory traversal|XSS|Command injection|1|Directory traversal (path traversal) vulnerabilities allow attackers to access files and directories outside the intended web root using relative path sequences like ../ to navigate the file system. SQL injection targets databases, XSS targets browsers, and command injection executes OS commands.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

What type of vulnerability exists when applications fail to properly validate user input?|Race condition|Input validation vulnerability|Cryptographic weakness|Privilege escalation|1|Input validation vulnerabilities occur when applications don't properly validate, sanitize, or filter user input. This can lead to injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command), buffer overflows, and other exploits. Race conditions involve timing, cryptographic weaknesses involve encryption, and privilege escalation gains higher access.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

Which vulnerability allows attackers to execute operating system commands through a web application?|SQL injection|Command injection|XSS|CSRF|1|Command injection (OS command injection) allows attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands through vulnerable web applications that pass unsanitized user input to system shells. SQL injection targets databases, XSS targets browsers, and CSRF exploits sessions.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

What is a zero-day vulnerability?|A vulnerability that's been known for years|A vulnerability unknown to the vendor with no patch available|A vulnerability that takes zero days to exploit|A vulnerability with zero impact|1|A zero-day vulnerability is one that is unknown to the software vendor and for which no patch is available. Attackers can exploit these before vendors become aware and create fixes, making them highly valuable and dangerous.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

Which vulnerability type allows users to gain higher privileges than intended?|Denial of service|Privilege escalation|Man-in-the-middle|Spoofing|1|Privilege escalation vulnerabilities allow users to gain elevated access rights beyond their authorized level, such as a regular user gaining administrator/root privileges. DoS affects availability, MitM intercepts communications, and spoofing impersonates entities.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

What vulnerability exists when cryptographic implementations use weak or outdated algorithms?|Configuration error|Cryptographic vulnerability|Input validation flaw|Race condition|1|Cryptographic vulnerabilities occur when systems use weak, outdated, or improperly implemented encryption algorithms, weak keys, or flawed random number generators. Examples include using MD5, DES, or weak SSL/TLS configurations. Configuration errors are broader, input validation is different, and race conditions involve timing.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

Which vulnerability arises from systems running outdated, unsupported operating systems?|Zero-day|End-of-life system vulnerability|Buffer overflow|Injection flaw|1|End-of-life (EOL) system vulnerabilities arise from running unsupported operating systems or software that no longer receive security patches. These systems accumulate known vulnerabilities over time without remediation. Zero-days are unknown vulnerabilities, buffer overflows and injections are specific technical flaws.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

What type of vulnerability exists in virtualization when guest VMs can break out to the host?|Container escape|VM escape|Hypervisor vulnerability|Resource exhaustion|1|VM escape (hypervisor escape) is a critical virtualization vulnerability where a guest virtual machine breaks out of its isolation to access the host system or other VMs. Container escape is similar for containers, hypervisor vulnerability is broader, and resource exhaustion is a DoS issue.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities

Which cloud-specific vulnerability involves misconfigurations in storage buckets or permissions?|Insecure APIs|Cloud misconfiguration|VM sprawl|Resource exhaustion|1|Cloud misconfiguration vulnerabilities occur when cloud resources like storage buckets (S3), databases, or access controls are improperly configured, exposing data publicly or granting excessive permissions. Insecure APIs involve programming interfaces, VM sprawl is about management, and resource exhaustion affects availability.|2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations|2.3 Vulnerabilities
