This exploits the fact that many AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), process user inputs as part of their system prompts or context windows.\n\nAccording to research from Anthropic and OpenAI, prompt injection represents a fundamental security challenge for AI systems because it allows attackers to bypass intended safeguards and manipulate model behavior.
