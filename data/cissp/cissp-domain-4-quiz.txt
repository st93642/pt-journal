RADIUS uses UDP, which is a connectionless protocol and does not guarantee the delivery of packets.|cissp|network-security
What is the purpose of context-dependent access control?|To restrict access based on the user's job role|To make access decisions based on the sensitivity of the data|To make access decisions based on the collection of information|To filter content based on specific strings like "confidential."|2|Context-dependent access control makes access decisions based on the context of a collection of information rather than on the sensitivity of the data. It reviews the situation and decides the appropriateness of access, such as a stateful firewall, making decisions based on packet sequences.|cissp|network-security
What does mobile IP technology allow a user to do?|Encrypt their data packets during mobile transfers|Use the same IP address even when moving from one network to another|Authenticate using biometrics on mobile devices|Access mobile networks at a reduced cost|1|Mobile IP technology allows a user to move from one network to another while maintaining the use of the same IP address. It provides a home IP address and a care-of address, with the latter changing as the user moves between networks while traffic is forwarded to the current care-of address.|cissp|network-security
What is a potential challenge with de-provisioning accounts?|It can result in a security breach|It can leave behind orphaned resources|It can cause network congestion|It requires extra staffing|1|A potential challenge with de-provisioning accounts is that it could leave orphaned resources, such as files or data, that are no longer accessible because the account that owned them has been removed. This can be wasteful and hinder business if the files are needed later on.|cissp|network-security
What should be done when de-provisioning a user account to prevent operational hindrance?|Inform all employees about the deprovisioning|Transfer ownership of the user's resources to another individual|Archive the user's account for historical purposes|Encrypt all files associated with the user's account|1|When de-provisioning a user's account, transferring ownership of the user's resources to someone else is important to prevent operational hindrance. This ensures that important files or data remain accessible and that the business can continue without disruption.|cissp|network-security
Which control would prevent a disgruntled employee from deleting financial statements?|Network architecture|Personnel controls|Perimeter security|Encryption and protocols|1|Personnel controls dictate how employees are expected to interact with security mechanisms and address noncompliance issues. They include procedures for hiring, termination, and access restrictions to prevent unauthorized actions such as deleting financial statements.|cissp|network-security
Which form of access control is primarily concerned with the flow of communication between network segments?|Network segregation|Supervisory structure|Cabling|System access|0|Network segregation, which can be both physical and logical, controls how different sections of a network communicate with each other, thereby managing the flow of data between segments.|cissp|network-security
What is the main purpose of implementing good access control practices in a network environment?|To increase the efficiency of the system|To make the user experience more personalized|To ensure security stays at a satisfactory level|To reduce the cost of the network infrastructure|2|The text emphasizes the importance of maintaining security at a high level by performing regular tasks as part of good access control practices. These tasks are crucial to prevent vulnerabilities and keep the environment secure.|cissp|network-security
What type of environments typically require the use of TEMPEST equipment?|Educational institutions|Commercial businesses|Military Institutions|Home offices|2|TEMPEST technology is complex and expensive, and therefore, it is used primarily in highly sensitive areas, such as military institutions, where the highest level of protection against electronic eavesdropping is necessary.|cissp|network-security
WHICH TYPE OF IDS uses sensors to monitor network communications?|Host-Based IDS (HIDS)|Network-Based IDS (NIDS)|Application-Based IDS (AIDS)|Protocol Anomaly-Based IDS (PAIDS)|1|NIDS uses sensors, often placed in promiscuous mode, to monitor network traffic and analyze it for signs of intrusion.|cissp|network-security
Which of the following is NOT a component of an IDS?|Sensors|Analyzers|Administrator interfaces|Encryption algorithms|3|An IDS generally consists of sensors, analyzers, and administrator interfaces. Encryption algorithms are used for securing data, not for the detection of intrusions.|cissp|network-security
Signature-based IDSs are unable to detect|Known attacks with existing signatures|Land attacks|Zero-day attacks|Attacks that match predefined patterns|2|Signature-based IDSs can only recognize attacks that have been previously identified and have signatures written for them. Zero-day attacks are new and do not have signatures yet, making them undetectable by signature-based IDSs.|cissp|network-security
Which type of IDS is capable of detecting new, unrecognized attacks by comparing activities to a learned profile of "normal" behavior?|Signature-based|State-based|Statistical anomaly-based|Rule-based|2|A statistical anomaly-based IDS operates by creating a profile of the environment's regular activities and then comparing new activities to this profile to identify anything that doesn't match, which could indicate a new attack.|cissp|network-security
What functionalities activate promiscuous mode on a Network Interface Card (NIC) Enable it to perform?|Encrypt all traffic passing through it|Capture all network traffic|Act as a firewall and block malicious packets|Perform heuristic analysis of network traffic|1|When a NIC is put into promiscuous mode, it captures all traffic on the network segment it is attached to, not just the traffic addressed to the host system.|cissp|network-security
In a switched network environment, why might it be necessary to use a spanning port for an IDS?|To encrypt data with a stronger algorithm|To reduce the overhead on the IDS|To capture traffic from all virtual circuits|To act as a redundant system for the IDS|2|In a switched environment, data is transferred through virtual circuits not accessible to a standard IDS sensor. By mirroring traffic to a spanning port, the sensor can analyze traffic from all circuits on the network.|cissp|network-security
What does a cryptosystem consist of?|Software, protocols, algorithms, and keys|Encryption, decryption protocol, and digital signatures|Passwords, usernames, and access controls|Firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems|0|A cryptosystem encompasses the necessary components for encryption and decryption to take place, which include software, protocols, algorithms, and keys.|cissp|network-security
What is the Least Significant bit (LSB) method in steganography?|A technique for encrypting messages with the lowest possible security|A method of embedding secret data by altering the least significant bits of a file|A method for creating the smallest possible file size for encryption|A technique for reducing the bit rate of an audio file for easier transmission|1|The least significant bit (LSB) method in steganography involves altering the least important bits in a file, such as a digital image or audio file, to hide secret data without noticeable distortion or file size changes.|cissp|network-security
