Which cloud service model provides the most control over infrastructure to the customer?|SaaS (Software as a Service)|PaaS (Platform as a Service)|IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)|FaaS (Function as a Service)|2|IaaS provides the most customer control, giving access to virtual machines, storage, and networks. Customers manage OS, applications, and data. PaaS provides less control (platform management by provider), SaaS provides least control (only application configuration), and FaaS is serverless with minimal infrastructure control.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

What is the primary security benefit of network segmentation?|Faster network speeds|Contains breaches and limits lateral movement|Reduces hardware costs|Simplifies network management|1|Network segmentation's primary security benefit is containing breaches by limiting lateral movement between segments. If attackers compromise one segment, they can't easily access others. Speed, cost, and management are not primary security benefits.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

Which cloud deployment model is exclusively used by a single organization?|Public cloud|Private cloud|Hybrid cloud|Community cloud|1|Private cloud is exclusively used by a single organization, providing greater control and customization. Public cloud serves multiple organizations, hybrid combines public and private, and community cloud serves multiple organizations with shared concerns.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

What architecture approach breaks applications into smaller, independent services?|Monolithic|Microservices|Client-server|Peer-to-peer|1|Microservices architecture breaks applications into small, independent services that communicate via APIs. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Monolithic is single, unified codebase. Client-server and peer-to-peer are network architectures.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

Which security zone typically contains public-facing web servers?|Internal network|DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)|Management network|Guest network|1|DMZ (screened subnet) is a security zone between internal and external networks, typically containing public-facing servers like web servers, mail servers, and DNS servers. This isolates them from the internal network while allowing external access.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

What is the primary characteristic of a zero trust architecture?|Trust all internal users|Never trust, always verify|Trust after initial authentication|Trust based on IP address|1|Zero trust architecture operates on "never trust, always verify" principle, requiring continuous verification for all users and devices regardless of location. It doesn't assume trust based on network location, initial authentication, or IP address.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

Which concept involves running multiple isolated OS instances on a single physical machine?|Emulation|Virtualization|Containerization|Cloud computing|1|Virtualization creates multiple isolated virtual machines (VMs) running different operating systems on a single physical host using a hypervisor. Emulation mimics hardware, containerization shares OS kernel, and cloud computing is a service delivery model.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

What security benefit does containerization provide?|Perfect isolation from host|Process-level isolation and portability|Complete hardware emulation|Direct hardware access|1|Containerization provides process-level isolation and application portability by packaging applications with their dependencies. Containers share the host OS kernel but are isolated at the process level. They don't provide perfect isolation, hardware emulation, or direct hardware access.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

Which infrastructure model uses code to define and manage infrastructure?|Manual configuration|Infrastructure as Code (IaC)|Point-and-click management|Ad-hoc provisioning|1|Infrastructure as Code (IaC) uses code to define, provision, and manage infrastructure, enabling version control, repeatability, and automation. Manual configuration, point-and-click, and ad-hoc approaches are less consistent and harder to audit.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

What is a primary security concern with IoT devices?|Too much processing power|Weak default security and difficult patching|Excessive encryption|Over-authentication|1|IoT devices often have weak default credentials, limited security features, difficult or impossible patching, and long lifecycles with infrequent updates. They don't typically have too much power, excessive encryption, or over-authentication.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

Which architecture concept best describes on-premises infrastructure?|Cloud-native|On-premises/on-prem|Serverless|Hybrid|1|On-premises (on-prem) refers to infrastructure hosted in an organization's own facilities with full physical control. Cloud-native is designed for cloud, serverless abstracts infrastructure, and hybrid combines on-prem and cloud.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models

What is the main security advantage of serverless computing?|Customer manages all security|Reduced attack surface through abstraction|More control over OS|Direct access to hypervisor|1|Serverless reduces attack surface by abstracting infrastructure management to the cloud provider. Customers focus on code, not OS, hypervisor, or infrastructure security. The provider handles patching and infrastructure security, though customers retain responsibility for application security.|3.0 Security Architecture|3.1 Architecture Models
